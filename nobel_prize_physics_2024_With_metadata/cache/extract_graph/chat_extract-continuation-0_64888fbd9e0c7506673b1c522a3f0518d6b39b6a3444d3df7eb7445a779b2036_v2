John Hopfield created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data. Geoffrey Hinton invented a method that can autonomously find properties in data, and so perform tasks such as identifying specific elements in pictures.\n\nWhen we talk about artificial intelligence, we often mean machine learning using artificial neural networks. This technology was originally inspired by the structure of the brain. In an artificial neural network, the brain’s neurons are represented by nodes that have different values. These nodes influence each other through con­nections that can be likened to synapses and which can be made stronger or weaker. The network is trained, for example by developing stronger connections between nodes with simultaneously high values. This year’s laureates have conducted important work with artificial neural networks from the 1980s onward.\n\nJohn Hopfield invented a network that uses a method for saving and recreating patterns. We can imagine the nodes as pixels. The Hopfield network utilises physics that describes a material’s characteristics due to its atomic spin – a property that makes each atom a tiny magnet. The network as a whole is described in a manner equivalent to the energy in the spin system found in physics, and is trained by finding values for the connections between the nodes so that the saved images have low energy. When the Hopfield network is fed a distorted or incomplete image, it methodically works through the nodes and updates their values so the network’s energy falls. The network thus works stepwise to find the saved image that is most like the imperfect one it was fed with.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton used the Hopfield network as the foundation for a new network that uses a different method: the Boltzmann machine. This can learn to recognise characteristic elements in a given type of data. Hinton used tools from statistical physics, the science of systems built from many similar components. The machine is trained by feeding it examples that are very likely to arise when the machine is run. The Boltzmann machine can be used to classify images or create new examples of the type of pattern on which it was trained. Hinton has built upon this work, helping initiate the current explosive development of machine learning.\n\n“The laureates’ work has already been of the greatest benefit.

With these ANN trained atomic \nmodels, considerably faster determination of phase stabilities and the dynamics of new materials \ncan be made. Examples showing the success of these methods involve the prediction of new \nphotovoltaic materials.  \nWith these models, it is also possible to study phase transitions [40] as well as the \nthermodynamical properties of water [41]. Similarly, the development of ANN representations \nhas made it possible to reach higher resolutions in explicit physics-based climate models [42,43] \nwithout resorting to additional computing power. \nDuring the 1990s, ANNs became a standard data analysis tool within particle physics \nexperiments of ever-increasing complexity. Highly sought-after fundamental particles, such as \nthe Higgs boson, only exist for a fraction of a second after being created in high-energy collisions \n(e.g. ~10-22 s for the Higgs boson). Their presence needs to be inferred from tracking information \nand energy deposits in large electronic detectors. Often the anticipated detector signature is very \nrare and could be mimicked by more common background processes. To identify particle decays \nand increase the efficiency of analyses, ANNs were trained to pick out specific patterns in the \nlarge volumes of detector data being generated at a high rate.  \nANNs improved the sensitivity of searches for the Higgs boson at the CERN Large Electron\nPositron (LEP) collider during the 1990s [44], and were used in the analysis of data that led to \nits discovery at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2012 [45]. ANNs were also used in studies of \nthe top quark at Fermilab [46].  \n8 (12) \nIn astrophysics and astronomy, ANNs have also become a standard data analysis tool. A recent \nexample is an ANN-driven analysis of data from the IceCube neutrino detector at the South Pole, \nwhich resulted in a neutrino image of the Milky Way [47]. Exoplanet transits have been identified \nby the Kepler Mission using ANNs [48]. The Event Horizon Telescope image of the black hole at \nthe centre of the Milky Way used ANNs for data processing [49].  \nSo far, the most spectacular scientific breakthrough using deep learning ANN methods is the \nAlphaFold tool for prediction of three-dimensional protein structures, given their amino acid \nsequences [50]. In modelling of industrial physics and chemistry applications, ANNs also play \nan increasingly important role. \nANNs in everyday life \nThe list of applications used in everyday life that are based on ANNs is long. These networks are \nbehind almost everything we do with computers, such as image recognition, language \ngeneration, and more.  \nDecision support within health care is also a well-established application for ANNs. For example, \na recent prospective randomized study of mammographic screening images showed a clear \nbenefit of using machine learning in improving detection of breast cancer [51]. Another recent \nexample is motion correction for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans [52]. \nConcluding remarks \nThe pioneering methods and concepts developed by Hopfield and Hinton have been \ninstrumental in shaping the field of ANNs. In addition, Hinton played a leading role in the efforts \nto extend the methods to deep and dense ANNs.  \nWith their breakthroughs, that stand on the foundations of physical science, they have showed a \ncompletely new way for us to use computers to aid and to guide us to tackle many of the \nchallenges our society face. Simply put, thanks to their work Humanity now has a new item in its \ntoolbox, which we can choose to use for good purposes. Machine learning based on ANNs is \ncurrently revolutionizing science, engineering and daily life. The field is already on its way to \nenable breakthroughs toward building a sustainable society, e.g. by helping to identify new \nfunctional materials. How deep learning by ANNs will be used in the future depends on how we \nhumans choose to use these incredibly potent tools, already present in many aspects of our lives.

John Hopfield created a structure that can store and reconstruct information. Geoffrey Hinton invented a method that can independently discover properties in data and which has become important for the large artificial neural networks now in use.\n\nThey used physics to find patterns in information\nIllustration\n© Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\nMany people have experienced how computers can translate between languages, interpret images and even conduct reasonable conversations. What is perhaps less well known is that this type of technology has long been important for research, including the sorting and analysis of vast amounts of data. The development of machine learning has exploded over the past fifteen to twenty years and utilises a structure called an artificial neural network. Nowadays, when we talk about artificial intelligence, this is often the type of technology we mean.\n\nAlthough computers cannot think, machines can now mimic functions such as memory and learning. This year’s laureates in physics have helped make this possible. Using fundamental concepts and methods from physics, they have developed technologies that use structures in networks to process information.\n\nMachine learning differs from traditional software, which works like a type of recipe. The software receives data, which is processed according to a clear description and produces the results, much like when someone collects ingredients and processes them by following a recipe, producing a cake. Instead of this, in machine learning the computer learns by example, enabling it to tackle problems that are too vague and complicated to be managed by step by step instructions. One example is interpreting a picture to identify the objects in it.\n\nMimics the brain\nAn artificial neural network processes information using the entire network structure. The inspiration initially came from the desire to understand how the brain works. In the 1940s, researchers had started to reason around the mathematics that underlies the brain’s network of neurons and synapses. Another piece of the puzzle came from psychology, thanks to neuroscientist Donald Hebb’s hypothesis about how learning occurs because connections between neurons are reinforced when they work together.\n\nLater, these ideas were followed by attempts to recreate how the brain’s network functions by building artificial neural networks as computer simulations. In these, the brain’s neurons are mimicked by nodes that are given different values, and the synapses are represented by connections between the nodes that can be made stronger or weaker. Donald Hebb’s hypothesis is still used as one of the basic rules for updating artificial networks through a process called training.\n\nIllustration of natural and artificial neurons\n© Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\nAt the end of the 1960s, some discouraging theoretical results caused many researchers to suspect that these neural networks would never be of any real use. However, interest in artificial neural networks was reawakened in the 1980s, when several important ideas made an impact, including work by this year’s laureates.\n\nAssociative memory\nImagine that you are trying to remember a fairly unusual word that you rarely use, such as one for that sloping floor often found in cinemas and lecture halls. You search your memory. It’s something like ramp… perhaps rad…ial? No, not that. Rake, that’s it!\n\nThis process of searching through similar words to find the right one is reminiscent of the associative memory that the physicist John Hopfield discovered in 1982. The Hopfield network can store patterns and has a method for recreating them. When the network is given an incomplete or slightly distorted pattern, the method can find the stored pattern that is most similar.\n\nHopfield had previously used his background in physics to explore theoretical problems in molecular biology. When he was invited to a meeting about neuroscience he encountered research into the structure of the brain. He was fascinated by what he learned and started to think about the dynamics of simple neural networks. When neurons act together, they can give rise to new and powerful characteristics that are not apparent to someone who only looks at the network’s separate components.\n\nIn 1980, Hopfield left his position at Princeton University, where his research interests had taken him outside the areas in which his colleagues in physics worked, and moved across the continent. He had accepted the offer of a professorship in chemistry and biology at Caltech (California Institute of Technology) in Pasadena, southern California. There, he had access to computer resources that he could use for free experimentation and to develop his ideas about neural networks.\n\nHowever, he did not abandon his foundation in physics, where he found inspiration for his under­standing of how systems with many small components that work together can give rise to new and interesting phenomena. He particularly benefitted from having learned about magnetic materials that have special characteristics thanks to their atomic spin – a property that makes each atom a tiny magnet. The spins of neighbouring atoms affect each other; this can allow domains to form with spin in the same direction. He was able to make a model network with nodes and connections by using the physics that describes how materials develop when spins influence each other.\n\nThe network saves images in a landscape\nThe network that Hopfield built has nodes that are all joined together via connections of different strengths. Each node can store an individual value – in Hopfield’s first work this could either be 0 or 1, like the pixels in a black and white picture.\n\nHopfield described the overall state of the network with a property that\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK<|>artificial neural network<|>A computational structure inspired by the brain's network of neurons and

to ab initio quantum-mechanical models. With these ANN trained atomic \nmodels, considerably faster determination of phase stabilities and the dynamics of new materials \ncan be made. Examples showing the success of these methods involve the prediction of new \nphotovoltaic materials.  \nWith these models, it is also possible to study phase transitions [40] as well as the \nthermodynamical properties of water [41]. Similarly, the development of ANN representations \nhas made it possible to reach higher resolutions in explicit physics-based climate models [42,43] \nwithout resorting to additional computing power. \nDuring the 1990s, ANNs became a standard data analysis tool within particle physics \nexperiments of ever-increasing complexity. Highly sought-after fundamental particles, such as \nthe Higgs boson, only exist for a fraction of a second after being created in high-energy collisions \n(e.g. ~10-22 s for the Higgs boson). Their presence needs to be inferred from tracking information \nand energy deposits in large electronic detectors. Often the anticipated detector signature is very \nrare and could be mimicked by more common background processes. To identify particle decays \nand increase the efficiency of analyses, ANNs were trained to pick out specific patterns in the \nlarge volumes of detector data being generated at a high rate.  \nANNs improved the sensitivity of searches for the Higgs boson at the CERN Large Electron\nPositron (LEP) collider during the 1990s [44], and were used in the analysis of data that led to \nits discovery at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2012 [45]. ANNs were also used in studies of \nthe top quark at Fermilab [46].  \n8 (12) \nIn astrophysics and astronomy, ANNs have also become a standard data analysis tool. A recent \nexample is an ANN-driven analysis of data from the IceCube neutrino detector at the South Pole, \nwhich resulted in a neutrino image of the Milky Way [47]. Exoplanet transits have been identified \nby the Kepler Mission using ANNs [48]. The Event Horizon Telescope image of the black hole at \nthe centre of the Milky Way used ANNs for data processing [49].  \nSo far, the most spectacular scientific breakthrough using deep learning ANN methods is the \nAlphaFold tool for prediction of three-dimensional protein structures, given their amino acid \nsequences [50]. In modelling of industrial physics and chemistry applications, ANNs also play \nan increasingly important role. \nANNs in everyday life \nThe list of applications used in everyday life that are based on ANNs is long. These networks are \nbehind almost everything we do with computers, such as image recognition, language \ngeneration, and more.  \nDecision support within health care is also a well-established application for ANNs. For example, \na recent prospective randomized study of mammographic screening images showed a clear \nbenefit of using machine learning in improving detection of breast cancer [51]. Another recent \nexample is motion correction for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans [52]. \nConcluding remarks \nThe pioneering methods and concepts developed by Hopfield and Hinton have been \ninstrumental in shaping the field of ANNs. In addition, Hinton played a leading role in the efforts \nto extend the methods to deep and dense ANNs.  \nWith their breakthroughs, that stand on the foundations of physical science, they have showed a \ncompletely new way for us to use computers to aid and to guide us to tackle many of the \nchallenges our society face. Simply put, thanks to their work Humanity now has a new item in its \ntoolbox, which we can choose to use for good purposes. Machine learning based on ANNs is \ncurrently revolutionizing science, engineering and daily life. The field is already on its way to \nenable breakthroughs toward building a sustainable society, e.g. by helping to identify new \nfunctional materials. How deep learning by ANNs will be used in the future depends on how we \nhumans choose to use these incredibly potent tools, already present in many aspects of our lives.
