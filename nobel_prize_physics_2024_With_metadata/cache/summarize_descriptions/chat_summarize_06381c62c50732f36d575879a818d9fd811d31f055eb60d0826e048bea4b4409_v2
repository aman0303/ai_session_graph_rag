It leverages principles from statistical physics, particularly the Boltzmann distribution and Boltzmann's equation, to model and approximate complex probability distributions. By incorporating hidden nodes, it is capable of learning and recognizing characteristic patterns in data, making it a powerful tool for generative modeling and applications such as recommendation systems. The Boltzmann Machine is notable for its ability to uncover statistical patterns and generate data-driven insights, reflecting its foundational roots in both artificial intelligence and statistical physics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1744189243, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 444, "total_tokens": 560, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in network analysis and interdisciplinary research within the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Physics.
