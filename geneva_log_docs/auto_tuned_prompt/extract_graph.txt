-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [command, configuration, service, event, parameter, monitoring agent, connection string, query, namespace, role, tenant]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is **English**., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 1:

entity_types: [command, configuration, service, event, parameter, monitoring agent, connection string, query, namespace, role, tenant]
text:
 the Ev2 cmdlets zip file you downloaded in the previous step.
2. Start new rollout with: 

  ```New-AzureServiceRollout -ServiceGroupRoot <path to ServiceRootFolder in example/or your deployment> -RolloutSpec RolloutSpec.json -RolloutInfra Prod -WaitToComplete```

3. Follow the status in [Ev2 Portal](https://ev2portal.azure.net/).

## Parameterize your config  
You can re-use the same configuration package across multiple cloud environments and with different parameters by enabling [scope tag binding](https://eng.ms/docs/products/ev2/features/parameterization/howtouse) in the main.xml file of your package. 

[Scope binding](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/GenevaLogs?path=/docs/EV2Extension/ConfigParamSample/ScopeBindings.json) is defined in a json file for a rollout that defines the binding values for the templatized files in a defined scope. An extended sample is available [here](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/GenevaLogs?path=/docs/EV2Extension/ConfigParamSample). 


## Manage your Configurations directly from Jarvis and EV2
You can make changes from Geneva UX portal directly with configuration editing capabilities using the Geneva Logs Configuration Source Control feature. This connects your configuration with an Azure DevOps repository and enforces code review by having configuration changes go through pull requests.

# Manage Geneva Logs using Ev2
The Geneva Logs Ev2 extension allows you to manage your Geneva Logs account and configuration as part of a zero-touch deployment using EV2.  If new to Geneva Logs or Ev2, it is highly recommended that you become familiar with basic concepts of each.  

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Download a [working example for the Geneva Logs Ev2 extension](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/GenevaLogs?path=%2Fdocs%2FEV2Extension%2FServiceGroupRootSample).  

**Learn more about:**
- [Geneva Logs](../../intro.md) 
- [Ev2](https://aka.ms/EV2)   


Follow these steps to complete initial set up and validation of your Ev2 based Geneva Logs deployment:  

1. [Configure environment prerequisites](../EV2/setup/prereq.md)
2. [Manage the Geneva Logs Namespace configuration](../EV2/setup/createconfigs.md)

## Samples
Download a [working example for the Geneva Logs Ev2 extension](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/GenevaLogs?path=%2Fdocs%2FEV2Extension%2FServiceGroupRootSample). 

**Note:** Ev2 is not supported for non-GSM accounts.
