It specifies the criteria for filtering events, which includes regex patterns for namespaces, event names, and locations. This class is essential for scoping down the events to be processed, allowing for more precise event matching and handling. Additionally, \"EVENTFILTERDETAILS\" encompasses settings that determine which events are matched and processed by the EventStreamProcessor, thereby ensuring that only relevant events are considered based on defined filters related to regions and namespaces.
