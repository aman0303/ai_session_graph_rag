It serves as an event name that identifies the specific event associated with a blob, facilitating the processing of events. Additionally, \"Name\" is represented as a string, which acts as a unique identifier for each event, allowing users to pinpoint the exact event being processed. Furthermore, in the context of RowSet, \"Name\" functions as an identifier for each column, enabling access to specific data within the rows.
