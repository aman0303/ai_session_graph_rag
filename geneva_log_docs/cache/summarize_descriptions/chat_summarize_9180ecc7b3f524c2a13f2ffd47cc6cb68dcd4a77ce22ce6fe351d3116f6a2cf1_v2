It supports the storage of data that requires GDPR annotations and can handle logs that have undergone PII scrubbing, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. COSMOS is capable of receiving streamed events for real-time storage and analysis, making it a scalable solution for log data management.\n\nThe service integrates seamlessly with Geneva Logs, allowing for the export and processing of log data, which enhances its capabilities for high availability and scalability. COSMOS facilitates data streaming and integration for effective log management, although it may occasionally show duplicate records due to multiple event hub notifications, which can impact data integrity in DGrep.\n\nAdditionally, COSMOS offers a globally distributed database, enabling the management of data across multiple regions, which is particularly beneficial for organizations that require robust and flexible data storage solutions.
