It allows users to perform complex queries on extensive datasets, making it particularly valuable for organizations that require advanced data management and analysis capabilities. Kusto integrates seamlessly with Geneva, enabling the streaming of monitoring data and facilitating the analysis of logs exported from Geneva Logs, including those processed through scrubbing rules and containing GDPR annotations.\n\nThe service is capable of ingesting indexed data, which enhances search speed and reduces the data volume processed during queries. Kusto also supports the reception of streamed events from various services, further broadening its analytical capabilities. It is often utilized in conjunction with DGrep for log analysis and is compatible with Azure services, reinforcing its role in big data analytics.\n\nHowever, users should be aware that Kusto can experience issues such as duplicate records, particularly when event hub notifications are misconfigured, similar to challenges faced by Cosmos. Overall, Kusto stands out as a powerful platform for managing and analyzing large datasets, providing essential tools for organizations looking to leverage their data effectively.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1744460279, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ded0d14823", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 625, "total_tokens": 840, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and network mapping.
