Primarily, it serves to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column, facilitating the integration of data from different sources. This functionality is crucial in database operations, allowing for comprehensive data retrieval and analysis. Additionally, \"JOIN\" can also refer to the concatenation of strings or data elements, which is often employed in formatting data for display purposes. In the context of Kusto Query Language (KQL), the join operator specifically performs the same function of merging rows from multiple tables based on shared columns, further emphasizing its importance in data manipulation and query execution.
