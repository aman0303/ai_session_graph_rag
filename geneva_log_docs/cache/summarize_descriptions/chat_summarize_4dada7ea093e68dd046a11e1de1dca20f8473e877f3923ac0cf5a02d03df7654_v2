Each storage account provides a unique namespace, facilitating the organization and access of data. These accounts are versatile, allowing users to store and manage data with various replication types available to enhance resiliency. Additionally, Storage Accounts are utilized by Geneva Logs to store monitoring data, offering options for different redundancy and replication strategies to ensure data integrity and availability.
