In this context, \"Duration\" is set to PT5M (5 minutes), indicating the active time period for a specific event. Additionally, it serves as a measure of the length of time for which an event or operation is evaluated, often utilized in performance metrics to assess efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, \"Duration\" also specifies the retention period for event data, which is set to PT1M (1 minute) in this instance, highlighting its importance in data management and analysis. Lastly, it is an attribute found in the MA configuration file, where it determines the frequency or interval at which derived events are executed.
