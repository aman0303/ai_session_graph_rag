It leverages the same infrastructure that powers the DGrep log search user interface, distributing workloads across multiple nodes to enhance query speed and efficiency. The SDK allows for seamless integration of DGrep functionalities into applications, providing developers with the tools necessary for querying logs and offloading log download and processing tasks to the DGrep backend. Additionally, it supports certificate-based authentication, ensuring secure access to DGrep services. Overall, the DGREP SDK serves as a vital resource for developers looking to implement logging and monitoring capabilities within their applications, streamlining the process of log management and data retrieval.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1744460341, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ded0d14823", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 443, "total_tokens": 594, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and network mapping.
