It represents the original timestamp of a source event, ensuring that the exact time an operation was performed is accurately preserved. This timestamp is crucial for maintaining the integrity of time representation in logs, especially when groupby operations are not employed. By incorporating the PreciseTimeStamp, users can filter logs effectively, allowing for precise analysis and retrieval of event data based on the original event timing.
