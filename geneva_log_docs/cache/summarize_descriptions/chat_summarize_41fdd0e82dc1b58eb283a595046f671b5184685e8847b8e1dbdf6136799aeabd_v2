This functionality enables comprehensive data analysis across all available data, facilitating a thorough examination of logs. The execution of a client query is centralized, leveraging the results obtained from a preceding server query, which enhances the speed and interactivity of log analysis. Additionally, the client query provides the capability for further filtering of results on the client side, allowing users to concentrate on specific errors without the need to re-run the server query. This combination of features makes the client query a powerful tool for efficient data analysis and error identification in cloud computing and monitoring systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1744460339, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_b705f0c291", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 325, "total_tokens": 461, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and network mapping.
