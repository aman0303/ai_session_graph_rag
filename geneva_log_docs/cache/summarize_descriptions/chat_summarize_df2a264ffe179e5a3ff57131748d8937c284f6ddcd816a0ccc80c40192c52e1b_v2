It collects and analyzes log data from multiple sources, including containerized applications and Azure services such as Container Insights. The service supports the ingestion and management of log data, ensuring centralized storage and compliance with regulations like GDPR.\n\nGeneva Logs enables users to access and query log data through the DGrep SDK, allowing for efficient log searches and analysis. It integrates with various Azure services, including AzureVPN for secure access, and is compatible with multiple platforms, including Windows and Linux. The service operates in distinct environments for logging and monitoring, such as TEST, PROD, and nCLOUD, and provides logging capabilities for applications, helping teams effectively monitor and manage their services.\n\nAdditionally, Geneva Logs offers functionalities for managing log data configurations through interfaces like Jarvis UI and PowerShell Cmdlets. It supports the collection of diagnostic, audit, and security logs, and allows for the routing of events to different storage accounts based on user-defined settings. The service is also integrated with security groups for managing access and permissions, and it is recommended to have dedicated subscriptions for optimal management. Furthermore, Geneva Logs tracks resources and manages key rotations for registered resources in Azure, enhancing its utility in cloud computing and monitoring systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1744460219, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_b705f0c291", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 263, "prompt_tokens": 951, "total_tokens": 1214, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and network mapping.
