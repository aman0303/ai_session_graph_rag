This software development kit (SDK) provides a robust set of tools and packages that allow developers to extend the functionality of Azure services, particularly in the realms of logging and monitoring. It supports interaction with Event Hubs in Azure, making it a valuable resource for monitoring and logging purposes.\n\nThe Extensibility SDK empowers teams to implement processors on their data streams, thereby enhancing Geneva services to align with specific business needs. It is particularly recommended for data-intensive scenarios or use cases that are not adequately addressed by the DGrep SDK. Additionally, the SDK offers a framework for custom integrations and enhancements, allowing for greater flexibility in extending the capabilities of Geneva Monitoring services and Geneva Logs. Overall, the Extensibility SDK serves as a vital tool for developers looking to optimize their logging and monitoring solutions within the Azure ecosystem.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1744460273, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ded0d14823", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 517, "total_tokens": 710, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in community analysis and network mapping.
