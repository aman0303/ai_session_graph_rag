These conditions serve to limit the number of processed blobs, thereby managing resource usage and preventing throttling. They leverage indexed fields to filter and optimize search results in log data, ensuring that only relevant information is retrieved. By specifying which indexed fields to utilize, scoping conditions enhance the precision of search queries. This precision is crucial as it not only improves the speed of searches but also increases the efficiency of data retrieval. Commonly used fields in scoping conditions include Region, Moniker, and Identity, which help in accurately matching blobs for search purposes.
