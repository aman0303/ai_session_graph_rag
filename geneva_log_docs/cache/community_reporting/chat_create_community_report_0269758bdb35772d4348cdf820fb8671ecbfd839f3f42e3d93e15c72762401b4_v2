It is designed to facilitate complex queries and the analysis of metrics over time by synthesizing data from various sources. Derived Events are generated based on specific conditions and can incorporate queries that filter or manipulate data from other events, enhancing their analytical capabilities.\n\nThese events are particularly valuable for monitoring and alerting purposes, as they are often created from the processing of log data. They enable users to perform intricate data manipulations, including the execution of JOIN operations across multiple event streams and tables. Additionally, a Derived Event can be generated from existing data or events, allowing for further processing and indexing of particular data points within the original event.\n\nFurthermore, Derived Events process data from multiple storage accounts and write the results to a default storage account, which results in the creation of separate Geneva Logs tables. However, it is important to note that the current implementation does not support selective indexing through the Jarvis UI.
