It functions as a distributed service that enables users to efficiently search and analyze log data across various event types and configurations. DGrep is characterized by its highly parallelized brute force log search capabilities, allowing for real-time querying of logs, which is particularly beneficial for interactive log analysis.\n\nThe tool employs a specialized query language that facilitates data retrieval and analysis through operations such as grouping, joining, and filtering. It enhances search efficiency by utilizing the Index Event stored in Kusto, minimizing the volume of data that needs to be searched. Additionally, DGrep allows users to run client queries on results produced by server queries, optimizing performance through in-memory execution.\n\nDGrep interacts with Kusto databases to manage data ingestion and indexing, providing a user-friendly interface for configuration. It processes and queries logs from storage accounts, offering insights and error handling for log data. However, it is important to note that DGrep requires logs to be collected and pushed to it for support requests to be addressed, ensuring that logs remain searchable.\n\nThe service scrubs data tagged as 'in scope' for queries executed from outside of the EUDB, thereby ensuring compliance with Schrems II regulations. DGrep supports a subset of the Kusto query language for querying and analyzing data within Geneva services and translates Simple Query language into KQL, allowing for non-language based querying. It also utilizes MQL for querying data within the Geneva ecosystem.\n\nOverall, DGrep is an essential tool for collecting and analyzing diagnostic data in various environments, including warm path
