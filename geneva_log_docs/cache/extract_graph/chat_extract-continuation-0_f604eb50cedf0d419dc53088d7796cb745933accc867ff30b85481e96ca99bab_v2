This tutorial, will walk you through the process of how to perform a log search to root cause and analyze the Live Site issue.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. A [Geneva Logs account](../../../getting_started/v2/createaccounts_basic.md)\n1. Enable [DGrep Logs](../../../logs/firstlog.md)\n1. Enable Access to [Logs](../Manageaccount/access.md)\n\n## Step-by-Step\n\n### 1. Specify the Event(s) to search\n\nWe could specify one or more events to search. These are the source event(s) that contains the logs for your service. \n\n![Input endpoint, namespace and event name(s).](../images/dgrep_EventInput.png \"Input endpoint, namespace and event name(s).\")\n\n### 2. Specify time range and scoping conditions\n\nInput the time range for which the issue is active. Lets say we also know the clusters where the issue is happening. Scope the search down to those individual clusters, thereby excluding other clusters from the search. These help to speed up the search greatly.\n\n![Input time range and search scopes.](../images/dgrep_ScopeInput.png \"Input time range and search scopes.\")\n\n### 3. Specify the server query\n\nTo diagnose the issue, lets say, we want to look only at those logs that indicate errors. So, specify this condition in the server query and hit the search button.\n\n![Input server side query.](../images/dgrep_FilterInput.png \"Input server side query.\")\n\n### 4. Specify the client query\n\nNow, we've got some results. Want to quickly iterate on the errors, without having to wait for DGrep to re-run a parallel query. So, lets filter on the client side and look for a specific error.\n\n![Input client side query.](../images/dgrep_ClientQuery.png \"Input client side query.\")\n\n### 5. Observe logs in the output pane\n\nThe logs output now reflects the final result of all the search criteria we entered from steps 1 through 4.\n\n![Output logs.](../images/dgrep_Output.png \"Output logs.\")\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>TENANT<|>A Geneva Logs account is required to access and manage logs for analysis and troubleshooting in the Live Site environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREP LOGS<|>SERVICE<|>DGrep Logs is a service that enables searching and analyzing logs to diagnose issues in the Live Site.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT<|>PARAMETER<|>Events are specific occurrences in the logs that can be specified for searching to identify issues related to the service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIME RANGE<|>PARAMETER<|>The time range parameter defines the period during which the issue is active and helps narrow down the search results.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVER QUERY<|>QUERY<|>The server query is a condition specified to filter logs based on certain criteria, such as errors, to diagnose issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIENT QUERY<|>QUERY<|>The client query allows for further filtering of results on the client side to focus on specific errors without re-running the server query.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OUTPUT PANE<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>The output pane displays the final results of the log search based on the criteria specified in the previous steps.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>DGREP LOGS<|>A Geneva Logs account is necessary to enable and utilize the DGrep Logs service for log analysis.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP LOGS<|>EVENT<|>DGrep Logs allows users to specify events to search for in the logs, which is essential for diagnosing issues.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP LOGS<|>TIME RANGE<|>The time range parameter is used in DGrep Logs to limit the search to a specific period when the issue occurred.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVER QUERY<|>DGREP LOGS<|>The server query is a critical component of DGrep Logs that helps filter logs based on specified conditions.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIENT QUERY<|>DGREP LOGS<|>The client query enhances the functionality of DGrep Logs by allowing users to filter results further after the initial search.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OUTPUT PANE<|>DGREP LOGS<|>The output pane is where the results of the DGrep Logs search are displayed, reflecting the applied search criteria.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
