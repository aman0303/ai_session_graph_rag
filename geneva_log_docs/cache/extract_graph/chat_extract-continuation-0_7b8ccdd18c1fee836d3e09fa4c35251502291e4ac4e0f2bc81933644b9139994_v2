You can link together any number of these clauses, except for the block clause (if-else) and join. The block clause must follow a series of let clauses that start the query. You can only have one join per query.  \n\n```\n<LetClause>  \n<BlockClause>  \n<WhereClause>  \n<GroupClause>  \n<SelectClause>  \n<JoinClause>  \n```\n  \nThe LINQ clauses are used to pipe data from one clause to another. The initial data comes from a stream of source events, which have an initial set of fields. You add to those fields let clauses. If you have no clauses in your query the input fields are just copied to the output fields. For example if your event fields are a, b, c, and you have one let clauses defined as \"let d=a+b\". Your output fields now include a, b, c, and d.  \n  \nThe groupby and select clauses are used to restrict fields. For example, if your event fields are a, b, c, and you have the following query. The result is the fields a, b, and d, where field c is not included.  \n  \ngroupby a, b  \nlet d=sum(c)  \n  \nIn this example with the same input you are also removing c from the output, but there is no  \ngrouping of similar values of a and b, so the number of output rows are the same as the number  \nof input rows.  \n  \nselect a, b  \nlet d=a+b  \n  \nThe where clause can be used to filter out rows from the output either before or after you  \nrestrict the field columns with select or groupby.\n\n\n\n**if-else clauses**  \n  \nStatement block variable assignments have the same semantics as a let clause assignment. A variable  \nin a statement block must first be declared in a let clause. For example if your input is  \na=1, b=2, c=3 and you have the following query with one if-else statement block your output is  \na=1,b=2,c=3,k=10. All if-else statement blocks must be contiguous (i.e. you cannot place a let between  \ntwo if statements) and they must occur before any select or groupby clauses. Only let clauses can be defined before your contiguous if-else blocks.\n\n\n\nOne important thing to note about if-else clauses is that fields assigned within the if-else clauses are not resolved to the new values until after the if-else blocks. This means if you assign a field within a if-else clause and use in in a subsequent if clause, the field still retains its pre-assigned value at that point. In this example, the *k* variable is the initialized value of *a*until after the if-else.  \n  \nlet k = a  \nif (b == 2)  \n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n  \nk = 10;  \n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n  \nelse  \n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n  \nk = 20;  \n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n\n\n\n**TimeStamp**  \nThe time stamp is always the first field of a row and set to the start time of the query.  \nIf groupby is not used a field representing the time stamp from the original source event  \nis added as a field named PreciseTimeStamp.  \nYou can also access the original input row's time stamp by using the field keyword, TIMESTAMP, in  \nyour query.\n\n\n## Identity Columns\n\n\nIf your identity is \"TenantRole\", the input columns for every event from a local source to  \na central destination (i.e. storeType=\"CentralBond\") includes the fields *Tenant*, *Role*, and *RoleInstance*. A local sourced event  \nincludes events from counters, Etw providers, etc... Local sourced events also include derived events  \nwith the store type set as local.  \n  \nThe identity columns are not included if your store type is local. If you need to refer  \nto those columns in your query for a local store event, you must set them with let clauses  \nexplicitly. For example you could do this: 'let MyRole=GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MONITORING\\_ROLE\")'  \nSee identity comments for more details.\n\n\n\nWhen your storeType is CentralBond, make sure any derived event that has a local source (i.e. the DE is run by MA and not the central Geneva service) includes all of the identity component names in groupby and select clauses. Those identity names are *Tenant*, *Role*, and *RoleInstance*if you use the default *TenantRole*identity type. If you use your own custom identity components, those should be included in the select and groupby clauses.\n\n\n\n<DerivedEvent source=\"CounterTable\" duration=\"PT5M\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" eventName=\"CounterRollupQuery\">\n\n\n\n<Query> <![CDATA[ **groupby**Tenant, Role, RoleInstance,CounterName let SampleCount=Count() let CounterValue=Average(CounterValue) ]]> </Query>\n\n\n\n</DerivedEvent>\n\n\n\n<DerivedEvent source=\"CounterTable\" duration=\"PT5M\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" eventName=\"CountersGetNameOnlyQuery\">\n\n\n\n<Query> <![CDATA[ **select**Tenant, Role, RoleInstance,CounterName ]]> </Query>\n\n\n\n</DerivedEvent>\n\n\n\n**Time and Partitions (\"Central\" table format only)**  \n  \nYou can override (not applicable for CentralBond) the default behavior for time and identity by explicitly setting the partition  \nand row keys. See the derived event for AlertEtwEvent as an example. That example also specifies  \nwhich columns are selected by default if you do not restrict fields with either groupby or select.\n\n\n## Language\n\n\n| \n\n<QUERY> ::= [ <QueryVariable> ]\\* | [\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DERIVED EVENTS QUERY LANGUAGE<|>NAMESPACE<|>Derived Events Query Language is a framework that supports various clauses for querying derived events, allowing for complex data manipulation and retrieval.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LET CLAUSE<|>COMMAND<|>The Let Clause is used to define new variables or fields in a query, allowing for the transformation of data as it flows through the query.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOCK CLAUSE<|>COMMAND<|>The Block Clause is a conditional structure that allows for the execution of a series of statements based on specified conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHERE CLAUSE<|>COMMAND<|>The Where Clause is used to filter the results of a query based on specified conditions, determining which rows are included in the output.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUP CLAUSE<|>COMMAND<|>The Group Clause is used to aggregate data based on specified fields, allowing for summary statistics to be calculated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SELECT CLAUSE<|>COMMAND<|>The Select Clause is used to specify which fields should be included in the output of a query, allowing for data restriction.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOIN CLAUSE<|>COMMAND<|>The Join Clause is used to combine data from multiple sources based on a common field, enabling complex data relationships to be queried.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIMESTAMP<|>PARAMETER<|>The Timestamp is a field that records the start time of a query, providing context for when the data was retrieved.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDENTITY COLUMNS<|>PARAMETER<|>Identity Columns are specific fields that are included in events to uniquely identify the source and context of the data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENANTROLE<|>ROLE<|>TenantRole is an identity type that includes Tenant, Role, and RoleInstance fields for events sourced from local to central destinations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRALBOND<|>TENANT<|>CentralBond is a store type that indicates events are processed centrally, requiring specific identity components to be included in queries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTERTABLE<|>NAMESPACE<|>CounterTable is a data source that provides event data for querying, often used in derived events for aggregation and analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTERROLLUPQUERY<|>EVENT<|>CounterRollupQuery is a derived event that aggregates counter data over a specified duration, producing summary statistics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTERGETNAMEONLYQUERY<|>EVENT<|>CountersGetNameOnlyQuery is a derived event that retrieves specific counter names without additional aggregation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LET CLAUSE<|>BLOCK CLAUSE<|>The Let Clause can be used within a Block Clause to define variables that are then utilized in conditional statements.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHERE CLAUSE<|>SELECT CLAUSE<|>The Where Clause filters the data before it is processed by the Select Clause, determining which fields are included in the final output.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROUP CLAUSE<|>SELECT CLAUSE<|>The Group Clause aggregates data which can then be restricted by the Select Clause to determine the final output fields.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDENTITY COLUMNS<|>TENANTROLE<|>Identity Columns are essential for events that use the TenantRole identity type, ensuring proper identification of events.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNTERTABLE<|>COUNTERROLLUPQUERY<|>CounterRollupQuery retrieves and aggregates data from the CounterTable, utilizing its fields for analysis.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNTERTABLE<|>COUNTERSGETNAMEONLYQUERY<|>CountersGetNameOnlyQuery accesses the CounterTable to retrieve specific counter names without aggregation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNTERROLLUPQUERY<|>CENTRALBOND<|>CounterRollupQuery is executed with a storeType of CentralBond, indicating it processes data centrally.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNTERSGETNAMEONLYQUERY<|>CENTRALBOND<|>CountersGetNameOnlyQuery is also executed with a storeType of CentralBond, indicating it processes data centrally.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
