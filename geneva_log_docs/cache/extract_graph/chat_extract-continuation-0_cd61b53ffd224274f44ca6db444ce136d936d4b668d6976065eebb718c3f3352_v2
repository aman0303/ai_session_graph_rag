We also want to scope the search in event `Test/MyEvent` to a single `moniker: “wusmoniker”`*.\n\n    > [!Note]\n    > Notice that the event namespace, name, versions and monikers are specified as regular expressions. We use anchors (^$) to avoid matching strings for which the input is only a substring.\n\n1. **Identities:** we specify identity columns as a dictionary mapping identity names to lists of identity values. Identities are defined in the Geneva Logs configuration and are used to identify MA instances. \n\n    *In this example, we are only interested in identities were the Tenant is “WUS” and Role is either “Worker” or “Frontend”.*\n    \n    > [!Important]\n    > This `IdentityColumns` property is used to scope down the amount of data to search and it as a great impact on query performance.\n\n1. **ServerQuery:** We also provide a ServerQuery, which is an MQL query used to filter and process the logs downloaded from storage.\n    \n    To use a KQL server query, you must also set `ServerQueryType = QueryType.KQL`. \n    For instance,\n    a KQL server query functionally equivalent to the earlier MQL server query can be specified like this:\n    ``` C#\n    ServerQuery = \"source | where Level <= 2\",\n    ServerQueryType = QueryType.KQL,\n    ```\n\n1. **MaxRowCount:** This property limits the number of rows produced after applying the ServerQuery. This does not impact the rows fetched from storage.  \n\n    *In this example, we specify the maximum number of rows to collect as 750,000.*\n\n    > [!Note]\n    > The default value for this property is 500,000 and its maximum value is 1,000,000.\n\n## Client Query\n\n**Scenario:**\n \n So, we've run a DGrep search and it had returned several rows of results. Now, we'd like to further process and transform the output rows. Say we'd like to filter down the results further,then group them and order them but we'd like to do these without having to run another DGrep search.\n \n**Code:**\n```C#\nvar input = new QueryInput\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    ...\n    ServerQuery = \"where Level <= 2\",\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n;\n\nRowSetResult result = await client.GetRowSetResultAsync(\n    input,\n    @\"where Role == \"FrontEnd\" groupby Tenant let Count = Count() orderby Count\",\n    cancellationToken);\n```\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Run a Server query which returns rows where Level <= 2.\n2. Run a Client query which further narrows down to logs from a particular role, then count the number of rows by Tenant and then sort the results by count.\n\nTo use a KQL client query, you must also pass `QueryType.KQL` as last argument to `GetRowSetResultAsync()`. \nFor instance,\na KQL client query functionally equivalent to the earlier MQL client query can be specified like this:\n``` C#\nRowSetResult result = await client.GetRowSetResultAsync(\n    input,\n    @\"source | where Role == \"FrontEnd\" | summarize Count = count() by Tenant | order by Count asc\",\n    cancellationToken,\n    QueryType.KQL);\n```\n\n\n> [!Note]\n> The *Server query* is applied at blob level granularity, meaning it operates on *a chunk* of data from a *single event* at a time.\n> The *Client query* operates on the entire dataset of rows, returned by the Server query.\n\n## Single server query, multiple client queries\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nSo, we've run a DGrep search and it had returned several rows of results. Now, we'd like to further process and transform the output rows, but we'd like to iterate over the dataset several times and examine the output of each iteration.\n\n> [!Tip]\n> Client queries are run entirely in-memory, so they are a lot faster than server queries. To take advantage of that, DGrep allows running multiple client queries on top of results produced by a single server query.\n\n**Code:**\n```C#\nvar input = new QueryInput\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    ...\n    ServerQuery = \"where Level <= 2\",\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n;\n\nIDGrepQuery query = await client.RunQueryAsync(input, cancellationToken);\n\nvar count\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IDENTITYCOLUMNS<|>PARAMETER<|>IdentityColumns is a dictionary that maps identity names to lists of identity values, used to identify monitoring agent instances in Geneva Logs configuration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENANT<|>PARAMETER<|>Tenant is a parameter that specifies the identity of the user or organization in the Geneva Logs configuration, in this case, it is set to \"WUS\".)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE<|>PARAMETER<|>Role is a parameter that defines the type of user or service in the Geneva Logs configuration, with values \"Worker\" and \"Frontend\".)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARTTIME<|>PARAMETER<|>StartTime is a parameter that indicates the beginning of the time range for querying logs, set to 30 minutes before the current time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENDTIME<|>PARAMETER<|>EndTime is a parameter that indicates the end of the time range for querying logs, set to the current time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVERQUERY<|>QUERY<|>ServerQuery is an MQL query used to filter and process logs, in this case, it filters logs where Level is less than or equal to 2.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAXROWCOUNT<|>PARAMETER<|>MaxRowCount is a parameter that limits the number of rows returned after applying the ServerQuery, set to 750,000.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIENTQUERY<|>QUERY<|>ClientQuery is a query that further processes the results returned by the ServerQuery, allowing for additional filtering and grouping of data.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDENTITYCOLUMNS<|>TENANT<|>The IdentityColumns dictionary includes the Tenant parameter to filter identity values based on the specified tenant.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDENTITYCOLUMNS<|>ROLE<|>The IdentityColumns dictionary also includes the Role parameter to filter identity values based on the specified roles.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STARTTIME<|>ENDTIME<|>StartTime and EndTime define the time range for querying logs, establishing a relationship between the two parameters.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVERQUERY<|>MAXROWCOUNT<|>The ServerQuery is limited by the MaxRowCount parameter, which restricts the number of rows returned from the query.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVERQUERY<|>CLIENTQUERY<|>The ClientQuery operates on the results produced by the ServerQuery, indicating a direct relationship between the two queries.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
