See [here][GDPRRef] to learn more about GDPR. \n\n## How can you use Geneva to meet your GDPR needs?\n\nGeneva Logs enable you to meet GDPR requirements through two ways:\n\n1. Helping you set the retention policy on your monitoring data so that they are deleted within the mandated retention period depending on the sensitivity of your data. \n2. Helping you annotate your monitoring data with privacy classification and data export/delete handling methods in the monitoring configuration. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> GDPR annotation support only C+AI Taxonomy with [Privacy Tag][PrivacyTagDefinitions] and [Data Management (Handling)][DataManagementTags]. If you are using [NGP Privacy Tags Taxonomy][NGPTaxonomy], it's not fully supported in GDPR annotation.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> GDPR annotation is one option to tag (via tagging at source) but not mandatory. Geneva assets will be inventoried and visible both in [S360 Compliance][S360Compliance] and [DataGrid][DataGrid] where service teams can manually tag their assets.\n\n## Controlling data retention of your monitoring logs\n\nGeneva Logs enables you to set retention period for your logs to comply with GDPR regulatory requirements. This document describes how Geneva Logs garbage collection works, which will give you insights into how to set your log retention periods to stay compliant. \n\n### Garbage Collection\n\nGeneva Logs has a Garbage Collection worker service which periodically deletes monitoring data that are older than the retention days mentioned in the configuration files. The default data retention policy is set to 29 days. You can control how long Geneva retains your monitoring data by specifying a different value for retention days in your configuration. \n\nTo update the retention days value, go to [Jarvis](http://aka.ms/jarvis), and then to **Manage** > **Logs**. Log in to your account, and go to the **Configurations** tab. Choose the config file you want to update, and specify a value for the **Retention Days** in the **Global Collection Settings** tab in the configuration builder.\n\n![Retention period][RetentionPeriodImage]\n\nThis value can be overridden at an event level: go to the **What to collect** tab in the configuration builder. Choose the event you want to configure, and specify the retention days in the **Retention** field. \n\n![Retention period][PerEventRetentionPeriodImage]\n\nAlternatively, you can also set this value in configuration files directly. See [here](../../../collect/references/windows/events.md#attributes-1) for a reference on retentionInDays attribute. \n\n>[!Note] \n>Large values for Retention Days attribute could cost your team in terms of storage capacity.\n\nGarbage Collection (GC) is scheduled once per day, and the set of all events from across all accounts that need to be GC'ed are staggered over a 24 hour period. In every turn, a GC task is allocated a fixed window of time to purge as much data as can be purged, beyond the retention period. The window size is typically 3 hours. This means that from the point when you make a configuration change to the Retention Days attribute, it could take up to a maximum of 24 hours prior to your change is honored. The time it takes for all the data to be purged could vary depending on the volume of data being GC'ed. \n\nFor events that are in-scope of GDPR, the Geneva team will monitor the lag in deletion and will take appropriate actions to catch up and stay within SLA. For events that are not in-scope for GDPR, GC will continue to be best effort as before. GC will continue to get scheduled once every 24 hours and delete 3 hours worth of data. The clean up will depend on the volume of data to be deleted. If even after 3 hours data is not deleted we will continue to reschedule the GC events until clean up job has exited successfully. The Geneva team will monitor overall lag in GC and will take mitigating actions to keep it within reasonable bounds.\n\nAs noted above, GC will need at least a day to circle through all events in your config. So if your event is in-scope for GDPR and targeted to be deleted in 30 days, set the retention day for that event to 29 days. This will ensure that any data beyond 30 days is cleaned up.\n\nIf your event is targeted to be deleted in 2 days, set the retention day to 1 day. This will ensure any data beyond 36 hours is cleaned up.\n\n## Annotating logs through configuration\n\nAll data you collect that might contain customer identifying information must be tagged for GDPR compliance regardless of where they are stored. [S360 Compliance][S360Compliance] is the one-stop-shop for tagging all of your data. In order to simplify the tagging process for your monitoring logs, Geneva Logs support annotations on your monitoring configuration files directly. These annotations will flow through to GDPR pipeline automatically. \n\nAt present the Configuration Builder UX for Geneva Logs does not support GDPR annotations, however the underlying [configuration XML][] can be edited to include GDPR annoations directly. The following steps show how to add these annotations. \n\n- Open the configuration that defines your events from [Jarvis > Account > Logs Account Settings > Configurations](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/account/logs/configurations)\n- Click on the configuration that contains the events you want to annotate\n- Select the **Advanced** tab in Configuration Builder UX\n- Find the _EventStreamingAnnotations_ element in the main configuration file\n- Add an _EventStreamingAnnotation_ section for each of the events you want to annotate. See example below. \n\n````\n<EventStreamingAnnotation name=\"<Your Event Name>\">\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GDPR<|>EVENT<|>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation, a set of privacy regulations concerning the handling of customer information.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Logs is a service that helps organizations manage their logging data and ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETENTION POLICY<|>PARAMETER<|>The retention policy defines how long monitoring data is kept before it is deleted, which is crucial for GDPR compliance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING DATA<|>PARAMETER<|>Monitoring data refers to the logs and information collected by Geneva Logs that may contain customer information.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARBAGE COLLECTION<|>SERVICE<|>Garbage Collection is a service in Geneva Logs that periodically deletes monitoring data older than the specified retention period.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFIGURATION FILES<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Configuration files are used to set parameters like retention days for monitoring data in Geneva Logs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARVIS<|>SERVICE<|>Jarvis is a management interface for Geneva Logs where users can configure settings and manage their logs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT STREAMING ANNOTATION<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Event Streaming Annotations are used to tag events in monitoring logs for GDPR compliance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>GDPR<|>Geneva Logs is designed to help organizations comply with GDPR requirements by managing their monitoring data effectively.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>RETENTION POLICY<|>The retention policy is a key feature of Geneva Logs that allows users to set how long monitoring data is retained to comply with GDPR.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GARBAGE COLLECTION<|>MONITORING DATA<|>Garbage Collection is responsible for deleting monitoring data that exceeds the retention period set in the configuration files.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONFIGURATION FILES<|>RETENTION POLICY<|>Configuration files are used to specify the retention policy for monitoring data in Geneva Logs.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JARVIS<|>CONFIGURATION FILES<|>Jarvis provides an interface for users to manage and update their configuration files for Geneva Logs.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVENT STREAMING ANNOTATION<|>MONITORING DATA<|>Event Streaming Annotations are used to tag monitoring data for GDPR compliance, ensuring proper handling of customer information.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
