I notice monikers with weird looking storage account / event hub names (like gsm16266*xt). What are these?\nThese are storage accounts / event hub namespaces that are automatically created by Geneva in your subscriptions on your behalf. A bit more housekeeping information on these resources can be gleaned by looking at the ARM tags associated with them in Azure portal as shown below. With GSM, this is nice-to-know information. \n\n![Tags on GSM resources][GSMTags]\n\n### 10. Azure subscription registered with GSM account is Unhealthy and firing alerts\nSubscriptions registered with GSM accounts turn unhealthy when the particular resource usage reaches a certain limit of the defined resource quota. Geneva has a default quota of 250 Storage accounts per region in a subscription, and a default quota of 1000 Event Hub namespaces per subscription. The health status of your account can be checked by going to your Geneva Logs account in the [Geneva Portal](http://aka.ms/jarvis), and clicking on the **Resources** tab. On that page you will see the list of subscriptions you have registered with Geneva Logs, the storage account and Event Hub usage for each subscription, and the health status. If your subscription is unhealthy, you can hover over the Unhealthy box and a tooltip will appear indicating why the subscription turned unhealthy.\n\nYour subscription will become unhealthy in the following cases:\n1. Storage account usage - you used over 235 of the 250 storage accounts available in a region.\n    Mitigation steps:\n    * Add another subscription to your logs account, and GSM will use it to provision resources.\n    * Remove unused storage accounts from the subscription.\n2. Event Hub usage - you used over 985 of the 1000 Event Hub namespaces available in the subscription.\n    Mitigation steps:\n    * Add another subscription to your logs account, and GSM will use it to provision resources.\n    * Remove unused Event Hubs from the subscription.\n\n> [!Note] \n> To avoid issues with your subscription, use a subscription that is dedicated to your Geneva Logs account.\n\n### 11. Will I get an alert when my subscription quota is about to run out?\nYes. GSM will file an ICM incident against your team when one of your Azure subscriptions is about to run out of storage or event hub quota. See [here](https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/details/94531899/home) for an example of the ICM incident that you will get. \n\n### 12. My Geneva accounts only authorize AME accounts, and when I use an AME account to run the Migration Tool validation, it fails with:\n```\nMigration failed with the exception: Failed to request a security token for realm 'svc://mds@production.diagnostics.monitoring.core.windows.net/' using available federation urls https://msft.sts.microsoft.com/adfs/services/trust/13/windowstransport, https://msft.sts.microsoft.com/adfs/services/trust/13/certificatemixed.\n```\nFrom command prompt, run the following to set an environment variable, then re-run the Migration Tool command -- set dstsfederationnamespace=ame.gbl\n\n### 13. How do I migrate my existing storage accounts from GRS to LRS or ZRS?\nGeneva Logs does not currently support migration of *existing* storage accounts from one replication type to another. To perform this migration, you have to submit a request to the storage team following these guidelines:\n* To migrate your GRS storage account to LRS you have to use Azure portal, PowerShell or CLI to change the replication setting. \n* To migrate your LRS storage account to ZRS you have to request a live migration with the storage team.\n* To migrate your GRS storage account to ZRS, you have to first migrate it to LRS, and then request a live migration with the storage team to move to ZRS. \n\nLearn [how to change the replication setting and how to contact the storage team](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/redundancy-migration), and stay updated on [AZ availability timelines and support](https://dev.azure.com/msazure/AzureWiki/_wiki/wikis/AzureWiki.wiki/60776/Storage-migrating-to-ZRS-or-GZRS).\n\n### 14. I get \"Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.,retrying...\" error while running GSM Migration tool\n```\nCaught exception Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.,retrying...  \nCaught exception Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.,retrying...  \nCaught exception Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.,retrying...  \nFailed to load security context from MDS, please retry the command  \nRunning validations.  \nAn error occurred while sending the request. \n```\nThis error occurs because the machine you are using to run GSM Migration tool is not TLS 1.2 enforced or it might be blocking with some firewall blockers. To avoid please check if there are any firewall blockers in your machine or switch to a different machine (escort operator if its in National cloud).\n\n### 15. Geneva Logs: Switching to use VRS (Variable Resiliency Storage) Storage Accounts\n\n> [!Note] \n> What does VRS replication type offer? VRS is not actually a different replication type; it is merely a way of specifying the use of existing (ZRS/GRS/LRS) replication types at the storage metadata level. If a region does not support the desired replication type, storage accounts created as VRS would temporarily belong to a fallback replication type and would later be automatically migrated to\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva is a service that manages resources such as storage accounts and event hubs in Azure subscriptions on behalf of users.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE ACCOUNT<|>NAMESPACE<|>Storage accounts are resources in Azure that allow users to store and manage data, and they are automatically created by Geneva in subscriptions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT HUB<|>NAMESPACE<|>Event Hubs are a service in Azure that allows for the ingestion of large amounts of data, and they are also created by Geneva in subscriptions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GSM<|>SERVICE<|>GSM (Geneva Service Management) is a service that monitors and manages the health and quotas of Azure subscriptions registered with Geneva.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA PORTAL<|>SERVICE<|>The Geneva Portal is a web interface for users to check the health status and resource usage of their Geneva Logs accounts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICM INCIDENT<|>EVENT<|>ICM incidents are alerts filed by GSM when Azure subscriptions are about to run out of storage or event hub quota.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIGRATION TOOL<|>COMMAND<|>The Migration Tool is a command-line utility used to validate and migrate storage accounts in Azure.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLS 1.2<|>PARAMETER<|>TLS 1.2 is a security protocol that must be enforced on machines running the GSM Migration tool to avoid connection issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VRS<|>PARAMETER<|>VRS (Variable Resiliency Storage) is a specification for using existing replication types at the storage metadata level in Azure.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>STORAGE ACCOUNT<|>Geneva automatically creates storage accounts in Azure subscriptions for users to manage their data resources.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>EVENT HUB<|>Geneva also automatically creates Event Hubs in Azure subscriptions for data ingestion purposes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>GENEVA<|>GSM monitors the health and quotas of Azure subscriptions that are registered with Geneva.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA PORTAL<|>GSM<|>The Geneva Portal allows users to view the health status and resource usage monitored by GSM.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>ICM INCIDENT<|>GSM files ICM incidents to alert users when their Azure subscriptions are nearing resource limits.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIGRATION TOOL<|>GENEVA<|>The Migration Tool is used in conjunction with Geneva to validate and manage storage accounts.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIGRATION TOOL<|>TLS 1.2<|>The Migration Tool requires TLS 1.2 to be enforced on the machine to avoid connection issues during operations.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>VRS<|>Geneva supports the use of VRS for specifying replication types at the storage metadata level.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
