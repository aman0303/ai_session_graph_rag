This can be configured for the whole account using [**defaultRetentionInDays**](../../collect/references/windows/events.md#attributes) or per event type using the [**retentionInDays**](../../collect/references/windows/events.md#attributes-1) attribute on the event source.\n\n## Why is my namespace/event/column still appearing in DGrep even after I removed it?\nDGrep list of namespaces, events and columns is built on hinting of data that was ingested. To remove these hints, use the \"Clear namespace/event hints\" dialog, which can be opened from the Settings tab.\n\n![clear hints image](../images/dgrep_ClearHints.png)\n\nYou will need access to the namespace to be able to remove hints from it.\n\n## Cosmos/Kusto show duplicate records whereas there is no duplication in DGrep\nIf MA sends multiple event hub notifications for a blob (due to retries, or misconfigurations), data will be duplicated in Cosmos and Kusto. DGrep has no dependency on event hub notifications -- it searches the storage account directly.  Hence, there will be no duplicates in DGrep data for this situation.\n\n## I see duplicate results after using the `summarize` or `groupby` operators. Why?\nDGrep is a distributed service and runs your *server* query on mulitiple machines. Therefore, `summarize` and `groupby` expressions are scoped to a single BLOB. To get expeced results, add your `summarize` or `groupby` expression to the *client* query as well. The client query runs on a single node and operates across all the data. There is an example of how to do this [here](../concepts/serverquery.md#distributed-nature).\n\n## How do I share a link to a DGrep query?\nClick on the \"Link\" tab in the left pane:\n\n![link dialog image](../images/dgrep_Link.png)\n\n## How to create parameterized link for DGrep? How can I programmatically create it?\n\nYou can use DGrep parameters to generate a link to a query.\nFor example for this link:\n```\nhttps://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/?page=logs&be=DGrep&time=04/13/2015 11:35Z&offset=-30&offsetUnit=Mins&UTC=true&ep=Test&ns=Aims&en=LogEvent&ver=3v0&su=MdsBvt1,MdsBvt2&role=Aims&roleInstance=Aims_IN_0, Aims_IN_1&conditions=[[\"Tenant\",\"%3D%3D\",\"a\"],[\"ActivityId\",\"contains any of\",\"a,b,c\"]]\n```\n\nfields are:\n* ep: Endpoint,\n* ns: namespace,\n* en: eventname,\n* ver: table version,\n* su: Scaleunit [obsolete (use scopingConditions) ] ,\n* role: Scaleunit [obsolete (use scopingConditions)],\n* roleInstance: Scaleunit [obsolete (use scopingConditions)],\n* conditions: Search conditions (Condition names are Case sensitive)\n\nYou can easily figure out other params in this link and craft your own.\n\n* The 'time' arg should specify timezone otherwise it will be considered client's timezone. (Either use Z(UTC) or the standard \"-hh:mm\" timezone format).\n* The 'offset' and 'offsetUnits' parameters specify the range around the given 'time'; valid 'offsetUnits' are \"Mins\", \"Hours\", and \"Days\", with `offset` being the quantity of those to use.\n* The 'UTC' arg is used to display/convert the provided time into either user's local time or UTC.\n* Parameterized link also supports aggregates, here is the example(Count by Role and Count by Level):\n```\nhttps://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/?page=logs&be=DGrep&offset=-2&offsetUnit=Hours&UTC=false&ep=Test&ns=Aims&en=LogEvent&ver=3v0&su=MdsBvt1,MdsBvt2&role=Aims&roleInstance=Aims_IN_0,%20Aims_IN_1&aggregates=[\"Count by Role\", \"Count by Level\"]&aggregatesVisible=true\n```\n* You can also use the \"dateFrom\" and \"dateTo\" parameters like following:\n    ```dateFrom=<YourTime>&dateTo=<YourTime>```\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > If you are using dateFrom and dateTo then don't use time, offset and offsetunits in parameters\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > (dateFrom and dateTo fields always changes time to UTC, so it is advised to use offset, offsetUnit and time params for local times)\n\n* You can have the search be relative to now by omitting the time parameter and just using offset and offsetunits\n* You can also use the dateFrom and dateTo parameters like following\n* You can also use scopingConditions , Like: scopingConditions=[[\"DataCenter\",\"PROD-BY-001\"],[\"OtherIdentityColumn\",\"Value\"]]\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > Monikers and EventVersions are special scoping conditions. Please use \"__Moniker__\" and \"__EventVersion__\" for name in URL.\n* For server query you can use parameter: serverQuery\n## How to troubleshoot Missing Data in DGrep?\n\nClick
