If you are facing such errors it is recommended to switch to KQL and follow the KQL documentation.\n> [!NOTE]\n> You may identify blank records/columns containing blank records by removing all filtering conditions.\n\n\n## Encountered authorization errors in the following storage accounts: ...\n\nDGrep was not able to authenticate to one or more storage accounts using the key contained in the Geneva Logs account. If your storage account is manually managed, this means that either the storage key was not correctly configured in the Geneva Logs account or that the storage key was rotated without being updated in Geneva.\n\nIn those cases, the Geneva Logs account administrator should update the storage key in Geneva to resolve the issue. Note, however, that this mitigation might take up to 6 hours to take effect due to caching.\n\nIf your storage accounts are managed by Geneva (i.e., through [GSM](../concepts/WhatIsGSM.md)) or if you believe the storage keys are correctly set in your Geneva Logs account, please [contact us](~/support/supportpolicy.md).\n\n## Could not find the following storage accounts: ...\n\nDGrep was not able to resolve the domain name of one of more storage accounts containing the logs to be searched. This likely means that those storage accounts have been deleted by someone with access to the subscription.\n\nTo resolve this, the Geneva Logs account administrator must either update the corresponding resource with credentials to a new storage account or remove the resource from the Geneva Logs account. In any case, data that was in the storage account before the deletion is permanently lost.\n\n## Encountered throttling errors in the following storage accounts: ...\n\nDGrep was unable to read logs from storage due to storage throttling. This could mean that those storage accounts are overloaded.\n\nTo resolve this, the Geneva Logs account administrator must scale out the Storage Group. If you are seeing this error consistenty and believe the storage account is not overloaded, please [contact us](../../support/supportpolicy.md).\n\n## Encountered connection failures in the following storage accounts: ...\n\nDGrep was unable to connect to one or more storage accounts. This happens when:\n* There is an Azure Storage incident impacting those accounts, or\n* There is an issue in DGrep causing connection failures\n\nThe DGrep team monitors these failures and will try to address them if they are caused by DGrep specific issues. If you are getting these errors consistently and you don't believe there is an Azure Storage outage, please [contact us](../../support/supportpolicy.md).\n\n## Found corrupted logs in storage.\n\nDGrep was unable to read data from storage because it was corrupted. This is usually caused by one of the DateTime columns not being in the correct format. Simple query language and KQL enforce a ISO UTC format for DateTime columns. \nAs a short term mitigation queries can be run via MQL. For the long term it is recommended to check where the logs are emited and verify that all DateTime columns are ISO UTC format.\n\nThis could also be caused by bugs either in the Monitoring Agent, the Ingestion Gateway or DGrep.\n\nThe DGrep team monitors these failures and will try to track down the root cause. If you are unable to search your logs due to this failure and have verified that it is not a DateTime format issue, please [contact us](../../support/supportpolicy.md).\n\n## Encountered an internal server error.\n\nThere was an internal server error in DGrep which caused the query to fail partially or completely.\n\nThe DGrep team is monitoring these failures and actively trying to eliminate them. If you are unable to search your logs due to this failure, please [contact us](../../support/supportpolicy.md).\n\n## Encountered an internal server error in the following regions: ...\n\nThere was an internal server error in DGrep which caused the query to fail partially or completely in a specific region. Search results from other Azure regions should still be accurate and complete.\n\nThe DGrep team is monitoring these failures and actively trying to eliminate them. If you are unable to search your logs due to this failure, please [contact us](../../support/supportpolicy.md).\n\n## Reached maximum schema count.\n\nDGrep and other Geneva services impose a limit on the number of schemas per event. This error occurs when more than 255 schemas are detected for a given event in a query. There are many reasons that can cause an excessive number of schemas, but these are the most common ones:\n* The logs are coming from a Linux application instrumented with fluentd and collected by the Linux monitoring agent (MDSD). In some versions of the fluentd SDK, field orders are not deterministic, and that causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of schemas. More details can be found [here](../../collect/instrument/linux/fluentd.md).\n* The logs are coming as schemaless JSON records through the [Interchange](../../connectors/asimov_to_geneva/overview.md) pipeline. In this case, the event configuration should define a fixed schema to be enforced during ingestion. More details can be found [here](../../connectors/asimov_to_geneva/management.md).\n\nIf neither of those is the case, please [contact us](../../support/supportpolicy.md).\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KQL<|>QUERY<|>KQL (Kusto Query Language) is a query language used for querying large datasets, particularly in Azure services, and is recommended for use over the previous Simple query language.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMPLE QUERY LANGUAGE<|>QUERY<|>Simple query language is a basic querying method that has been translated to KQL for improved functionality and performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREP<|>SERVICE<|>DGrep is a service that processes and queries logs from storage accounts, providing insights and error handling for log data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>TENANT<|>The Geneva Logs account is a tenant that manages log data and configurations for various storage accounts and services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE ACCOUNT<|>SERVICE<|>A storage account is a service that provides a unique namespace for storing data in Azure, which can be accessed by various applications and services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE KEY<|>PARAMETER<|>The storage key is a parameter used for authenticating access to a storage account, which must be correctly configured in the Geneva Logs account.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNAL SERVER ERROR<|>EVENT<|>An internal server error is an event that indicates a failure in the DGrep service, causing queries to fail partially or completely.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THROTTLING ERROR<|>EVENT<|>A throttling error occurs when DGrep is unable to read logs from storage due to overload on the storage accounts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORRUPTED LOGS<|>EVENT<|>Corrupted logs are an event where DGrep cannot read data from storage due to data format issues, particularly with DateTime columns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAXIMUM SCHEMA COUNT<|>EVENT<|>The maximum schema count error occurs when more than 255 schemas are detected for a given event in a query, leading to processing issues.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KQL<|>SIMPLE QUERY LANGUAGE<|>KQL is the recommended replacement for the Simple query language, indicating a direct relationship in functionality.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>DGrep operates within the context of a Geneva Logs account, processing and querying logs stored in it.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>STORAGE ACCOUNT<|>DGrep queries logs from storage accounts, establishing a direct relationship between the service and the storage accounts.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STORAGE KEY<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>The storage key must be configured in the Geneva Logs account to authenticate access to the associated storage accounts.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>INTERNAL SERVER ERROR<|>An internal server error in DGrep indicates a failure in the service that affects log querying capabilities.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>THROTTLING ERROR<|>Throttling errors in DGrep occur when the service cannot read logs due to overload in the storage accounts it queries.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>CORRUPTED LOGS<|>Corrupted logs are an issue that DGrep encounters when trying to read data, indicating a failure in data integrity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>MAXIMUM SCHEMA COUNT<|>The maximum schema count error is a specific issue that DGrep monitors when processing logs, indicating a limitation in schema handling.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
