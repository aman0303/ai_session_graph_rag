Install the [NuGet CLI tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools#nugetexe-cli).\n2. Register required NuGet sources (see [references](#references) section).\n3. Download the GenevaWarmPathPowerShellCmdlets NuGet by running the command below. When prompted, sign in with your regular Microsoft account.\n```bat\n    nuget.exe install GenevaWarmPathPowerShellCmdlets\n```\n\n## Sign in\n1. Import module\n\n    Module location ..\\GenevaWarmPathPowerShellCmdlets\\GenevaWarmPathPowerShellCmdlets.[version]\\lib\\net452\n    The location may be in c:\\Windows\\SysWOW64.\n```powershell\n    Import-Module .\\GenevaWarmPathClient.psm1\n```\n    \n2. Create credential object\n\n    Certificate and dSTS authentication are supported. Certificates can be retrieved by thumbprint or subject distinguished name. By default, certs identified by thumbprint are retrieved from StoreName.My and StoreLocation.LocalMachine.\n    Partial support is also included for Akv and Dsms certificates, which can now also be retrieved by Akv SAN and Dsms URL. However, the cmdlets currently do not support accessing the certificates directly from those systems. Instead, a copy of the certificate must be installed to the local user or machine store.\n    Alternatively, if just in time access to a remote managed cert is necessary, credentials can be created directly based on a certificate object that has been previously retrieved through a tool like the [Azure Powershell Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-4.3.0).\n\n```powershell\n    # Using cert\n    $credential = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.WarmPath.Cmdlets.CertificateCredential(\"1272457D65E7EB013519683A4B070338A2C2977D\", \"My\", \"LocalMachine\")\n\n    # Using local keyvault cert\n    $credential = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.WarmPath.Cmdlets.CertificateCredential(\"TestMDS100.geneva.keyvault.warmpathfecanary.cloudapp.net\")\n\n    # Using remote keyvault cert\n    $secret = Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName \"MdsAkvTest\" -Name \"test34343\"\n    $secretByte = [Convert]::FromBase64String($secret.SecretValueText)\n    $authcert = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2\n    $authcert.Import($secretByte, \"\", \"Exportable,PersistKeySet\")\n    $credential = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.WarmPath.Cmdlets.CertificateCredential($authcert)\n\n    # Using local dSMS cert\n    $credential = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.WarmPath.Cmdlets.CertificateCredential(\"/genevacustomers/monitoring/warmpath/public/test/test123/certificates/chained/testcert.pfx\")\n\n    # Using dSTS\n    $credential = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.WarmPath.Cmdlets.UserCredential\n```\n\n3.
