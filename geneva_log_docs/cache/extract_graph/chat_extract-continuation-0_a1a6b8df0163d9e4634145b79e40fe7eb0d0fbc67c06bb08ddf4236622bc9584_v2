Classic moniker failover -  If your Geneva Logs account is [Geneva Storage Management (GSM)-enabled](./gsm_gcsenabled.md) Geneva Logs will provision a single moniker in the requested region. If your account is not GSM enabled, you are responsible for provisioning a moniker in the requested region. \n    * If your Geneva Logs account is GSM-enabled, and no resources are yet available in the requested region, GSM will attempt to provision a moniker in the nearest region instead. If no nearest region is available, or GSM is unable to provision a moniker there, the request will fail. \n    * If your Geneva Logs account is not GSM-enabled, and no resources are yet available in the requested region, Geneva Logs will return at least one moniker from the nearst region, or from the nearest storage group.    \n2. Restricted moniker failover - enforce data residency in the requested region. Geneva Logs will only provision a moniker in the requested region. \n     * If your Geneva Logs account is GSM-enabled, and no moniker is available in the requested region, GSM will attempt to provision a new moniker.\n     * If your Geneva Logs account it not GSM-enabled, and no moniker is available in the requested region, no moniker will be returned. \n3. Geo Isolated moniker failover - enforce data residency in regions with traditional regional pair defined. Geneva Logs will return a moniker in the requested region as the primary moniker, and a moniker in the paired region as the secondary moniker.\n    * The paired regions (and thus the provisioned monikers) reside in the same geography. \n4. Dial Tone - prioritize having critical data available for recovery over data isolation.\n    * If a region has a traditional regional pair defined, Geneva Logs will return a moniker in the requested region as the primary moniker, and a moniker in the paired region as the secondary moniker.\n    * If a region has no traditional regional pair defined, Geneva Logs will return a moniker in the requested region as the primary moniker, and a moniker in the \"recovery region\" (as defined by Azure Global/DCMT) as the secondary moniker.\n\n## Onboarding to your chosen moniker failover option\n\n1. Upgrade your Monitoring Agent (MA) to version 45.0.1 or higher.\n2. Update the variable ```monikerRegionFailoverOption``` in the Management section in your configuration file with the failover option you require. Values for this variable can be either Classic, Restricted, GeoIsolated or Dialtone. \n\n![Failover Option](../images/FailoverOptionConfig.png)\n\n>[!Note]\n>If you choose Dialtone as a failover option, you must also have onboarded to [Geneva Ingestion Gateway (GIG)](../../../collect/references/genevaingestiongateway.md). Dial Tone support is only available for data written to GIG and not directly to storage. GIG supports connection to storage through IPv6, and will ensure telemetry collection in a different region during an outage.\n\n>[!Note]\n>Onboarding to [Geneva Ingestion Gateway (GIG)](../../../collect/references/genevaingestiongateway.md) is not required to meet data residency compliance when selecting Classic, Restriced, or Geo Isolated moniker failover options.\n\n>[!Note]\n>If no value is set for monikerRegionFailoverOption, the default is Classic, which is the previous behavior before the addition of this new functionality.\n\n>[!Note]\n>It is recommended to update the configuration on the Monitoring Agent after making the configuration changes to choose a moniker faliover scenario, and follow [Safe Deployment Practices](./MigrateToGCS.md#safe-deployment-practices-sdp).\n    \n## How will the moniker failover selection affect your logs data consumption? \nMoniker failover is an automatic process. That means that your logs may land in the paired region transiently, if the logs data plane is unable to write to a moniker in the primary region. Depending on your data consumption choice, consider the failover option and make updates accordingly:\n\n*\tDGrep - if you are using “Region” scoping condition, which filters on the region of the moniker, make sure to include the primary and paried regions. Otherwise there should not be any change. \n*\tKusto - if you using regional Kusto clusters, which are selected based on the region of the moniker, consider the primary and paired regions. Otherwise there should not be any change.\n* \tExtensibility SDK - if your SDK is configured to filter by moniker OR region, consider the parimary and paired regions. Otherwise there should not be any change.\n*\tGDS - data will land in an Event Hub based on the region of the moniker. Make sure you consider this when consuming data.\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MONIKER FAILOVER OPTION<|>PARAMETER<|>Moniker failover options are configurations that determine how Geneva Logs provisions monikers in response to data residency requirements and resource availability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLASSIC MONIKER FAILOVER<|>EVENT<|>Classic moniker failover is a scenario where a single moniker is provisioned in the requested region if the Geneva Logs account is GSM-enabled, or the user must provision it if not.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESTRICTED MONIKER FAILOVER<|>EVENT<|>Restricted moniker failover enforces data residency by only provisioning a moniker in the requested region, with specific behaviors based on GSM enablement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEO ISOLATED MONIKER FAILOVER<|>EVENT<|>Geo Isolated moniker failover ensures data residency in paired regions, returning a primary moniker in the requested region and a secondary in the paired region.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIAL TONE<|>EVENT<|>Dial Tone prioritizes critical data availability for recovery, provisioning monikers in the requested and recovery regions based on regional pair definitions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>The Monitoring Agent (MA) is a component that collects and manages logs, requiring updates to support new configurations and failover options.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONIKER REGION FAILOVER OPTION<|>PARAMETER<|>The monikerRegionFailoverOption is a variable in the configuration file that specifies the chosen failover option for moniker provisioning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA INGESTION GATEWAY (GIG)<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Ingestion Gateway (GIG) is a service that supports connection to storage and telemetry collection during outages, particularly for Dial Tone scenarios.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER FAILOVER OPTION<|>CLASSIC MONIKER FAILOVER<|>Classic moniker failover is one of the configurations available under the moniker failover options for Geneva Logs.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER FAILOVER OPTION<|>RESTRICTED MONIKER FAILOVER<|>Restricted moniker failover is another configuration option that falls under the broader category of moniker failover options.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER FAILOVER OPTION<|>GEO ISOLATED MONIKER FAILOVER<|>Geo Isolated moniker failover is also a specific configuration option within the moniker failover options.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER FAILOVER OPTION<|>DIAL TONE<|>Dial Tone is a specific failover option that is part of the overall moniker failover configurations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MONIKER REGION FAILOVER OPTION<|>The Monitoring Agent must update the monikerRegionFailoverOption in its configuration file to implement the chosen failover scenario.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>DIAL TONE<|>The Monitoring Agent is involved in the Dial Tone process, which requires specific configurations for data recovery.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA INGESTION GATEWAY (GIG)<|>DIAL TONE<|>Geneva Ingestion Gateway (GIG) is necessary for supporting Dial Tone scenarios, ensuring data is collected during outages.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
