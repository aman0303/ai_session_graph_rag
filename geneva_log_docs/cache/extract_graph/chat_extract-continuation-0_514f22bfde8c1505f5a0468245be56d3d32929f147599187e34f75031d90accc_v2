To take advantage of that, DGrep allows running multiple client queries on top of results produced by a single server query.\n\n**Code:**\n```C#\nvar input = new QueryInput\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    ...\n    ServerQuery = \"where Level <= 2\",\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n;\n\nIDGrepQuery query = await client.RunQueryAsync(input, cancellationToken);\n\nvar countByTenant = await query.GetResultAsRowSetAsync(\n    \"groupby Tenant let Count = Count()\",\n    cancellationToken);\n\nvar countByRole = await query.GetResultAsRowSetAsync(\n    \"groupby Role let Count = Count()\",\n    cancellationToken);\n\nawait query.CloseAsync(cancellationToken);\n```\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. We use the `DGrepClient.RunQueryAsync` API to get an object which implements the `IDGrepQuery` interface. This object exposes methods that allow the caller to interact with the DGrep backend.\n\n1. Next, we use the `IDGrepQuery` object to run two client queries, one that groups the rows by Tenant and another that groups them by Role.\n\n> [!Important]\n> We need to call `IDGrepQuery.CloseAsync` method after we are done with the query. This informs DGrep backend to dispose the query. See more about [Quotas](./sdk.md#quotas).\n\n## Writing search outputs to CSV files\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nLet's suppose we found the relevant logs we were looking for. Now, we'd like to download them as a CSV file for further offline processing.\n\n**Code:**\n```C#\nusing (var client = new DGrepClient(DGrepEndpoint, ClientCertificate))\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    // Perform relevant searches here.\n    // Download as CSV.\n    CsvResult result = await client.GetCsvResultAsync(input, cancellationToken);\n    Uri uri = result.CsvUri;\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n```\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. We invoke the `GetCsvResultAsync` method and DGrep saves the query results to a blob, which is a ZIP archive containing a CSV file.\n\n1. The blob can be accessed through the SAS URI returned by `CsvResult.CsvUri` and it is **valid for 6 hours**.\n\n## Advanced scenarios\n\n1. Retrieve results in small batches in order to limit the amount of memory allocated in the client.\n\n1. For purposes of Interactive applications, it is possible to run client queries and retrieve results before the server query is fully completed.\n\n## Next steps\n\n1.
