In that model, conversion rules can apply complex aggregation logic to large data sets, but that comes at the expense of higher latencies.\n\n## Conversion rule Limitations\n\n### Limitations on the conversion rule size, columns and values\n\n* The length of KQL query string within conversion rule is limited to 131072 characters.\n* Virtual columns `__SourceMoniker__` and `__SourceEvent__` available in DGrep are not supported in LogsToMetrics rules and should not be used.\n* Dimension values cannot be null or empty. In case a dimension is either null or empty, Logs to Metrics will fail with NullDimension error (error chart is available in [QoS dashboard](qos.md)).\n* Dimension names should adhere to [MDM metric data model rules for Dimensions](../../../metrics/concepts/datamodel.md#dimension).\n\n### Operators supported in conversion rules\n\nLogsToMetrics conversion rules are defined with operators in [MQL](../../References/DGrepQueryLanguage/mql.md) or [KQL](../../References/DGrepQueryLanguage/kql.md) that are applied to each data entry in serial manner.\nSince the transformation is applied either to each record individually, or to batches of data of unknown size, KQL operators that act on multiple records are prohibted. Only _streaming_ operators that take a single row as input and return no more than one row are supported. For example, [summarize](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/summarizeoperator.html) isn't supported since it summarizes multiple records.\n\nExamples of streaming operators in KQL are:\n[where](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/whereoperator.html),\n[extend](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/extendoperator.html),\n[project](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/projectoperator.html),\n[mvexpand](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/mvexpandoperator.html) and\n[parse]( https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/parseoperator.html).\n\nThe following operators are not streaming and can not be used in conversion rules:\n[take](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/limitoperator.html),\n[sort](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/orderoperator.html),\n[join](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/joinoperator.html),\n\n### Usage of scoping conditions\n\nOnly generic indexed columns are supported within scoping conditions in LTM rules. Indexes obtained using [selective indexing](../dgrep/selectiveindexing/selectiveindexing.md) are not supported.\n\n## Aggregation\n\nConversion rules should not use [summarize](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/summarizeoperator.html) operator to aggregate metrics and, preferrably, should emit raw, unaggregated metrics. The exception to this rule is to use summarize with `count()` and `sum()` aggregation functions **only** to aggregate metrics by bin(timestamp, 1m) if you are sending large volumes of data. Usage of other aggregation functions, such as `min()`, `max()` or `average()` will result in data inaccuracies.\n\nMetric aggregation will happen in MDM, according to user specified [preaggregates](../../../metrics/concepts/preaggregates.md) and [sampling types](../../../metrics/concepts/measurements.md).\n\n## Correlation\n\nThere are scenarios where it is desirable to monitor how two streams compare to each other.\nFor example, let's say that we have two log events being emitted by our service, OperationEvent and ErrorEvent.\nWe would like to raise an alert when the number of records in ErrorEvent is more than 5% the number of records in OperationEvent, in a given time window.\n\nMetric correllation with LogsToMetrics could be accomplished in the following way:\n\n* Create two separate conversion rules, emitting separate metrics for OperationEvent and ErrorEvent.\n* Create a [composite metric](../../../metrics/concepts/dataaggregation/compositemetrics.md) in MDM which computes the ratio between those two metrics.\n* Alternatively, we could use [correlated monitors](../../../alerts/AdvancedTopics/MonitoringOptions/CorrelatedMonitors.md) to raise alerts based on more complex comparisons between multiple metrics.\n\n## Percentiles\n\n[Percentiles](../../../metrics/percentiletutorial/percentiletutorial.md) can be enabled on any metric emitted as int or long (float and double values are not supported).\nValues produced by LogsToMetrics rules are float/double only if they come from log fields which are float/double,\nor if they are produced by functions that return float/double (for example: [log](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/log-function.html), [exp](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/exp-function.html), [pow](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/query/powfunction.html)).\n\nTo find a value's type, one can use the\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
