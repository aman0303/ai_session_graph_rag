That said, we recognize that there are emergency scenarios where updating service code or configuration to publish metrics can take a while. The LogsToMetrics connector will assist in generating metrics in the interim and allow you to address any monitoring gaps quickly.\n\nPlease consider the following factors before enabling this feature:\n* Since LogsToMetrics works on data from the Geneva Logs, the ingestion latency is higher than emitting metrics directly to Geneva Metrics.\n* The LogsToMetrics service has usage quotas, which are detailed in the [Limits and Quotas](./quota.md) section.\n\nDue to these restrictions, we recommend using this feature prudently and only when direct submission from your service nodes is not possible.\n\n# How does it work?\nMetrics are extracted from logs by running queries on the logs.\n\nThe queries are written in MQL or KQL and need to adhere to the following conventions:\n* There should be exactly one column of type `DateTime`.  This column is interpreted as the metric time. \n* All columns that start with `m_` and have non-negative numeric values are interpreted as metrics.  There should be at least one such column.  The metric name is the name of the column with `m_` stripped out.  For example, if you wish to publish a metric with name `MyMetric` and a value of `7`, your query should yield `m_MyMetric = 7`.\n* All columns that start with `d_` and are of type string are interpreted as dimensions. \n* The data type of the column is important.  In particular, using MQL, `d_MyDimenion = iif(Foo.contains(\"bar\"), \"1\", \"0\")` will be interpreted as a dimension whereas `d_MyDimenion = iif(Foo.contains(\"bar\"), 1, 0)` will not. There can be 0 or more such columns.\n* You can have multiple such queries for a given event.\n* Data deemed to be \"old\" (age > 20 minutes) is not sent to Geneva Metrics. The age of the metric is defined as `DateTime.UtcNow – metricTime`, where `metricTime` is the column defined in the first bullet point above. Similarly, any data that has a timestamp in the future will be dropped as well.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the queries are executed on each blob that is uploaded by the MA independently. This means that the rules simply apply filtering & projection transforms on the blobs and leaves actual grouping (i.e., aggregations) to Geneva Metrics.\n\n# How to use it?\nYou need to create a **conversion rule** for each log event for which you want to extract metric data.\nA **conversion rule** is the unit of configuration in LogsToMetrics. It essentially describes a mapping between Geneva Logs and Geneva Metrics. This mapping is described by means of a MQL query with the conventions mentioned above.\nEach **conversion rule** [is created from the Jarvis UI](./gettingstarted.md) and it is stored in the same Geneva Logs Namespace where the Logs are extracted from.\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS TO GENEVA METRICS CONNECTOR<|>SERVICE<|>The Geneva Logs to Geneva Metrics connector, also known as LogsToMetrics, is a service that extracts metrics from logs and publishes them to Geneva Metrics in a streaming fashion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA METRICS<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Metrics, also referred to as MDM, is a service that receives and processes metrics extracted from logs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IFX APIS<|>COMMAND<|>IFx APIs are interfaces that allow direct publishing of metrics from running services to Geneva Metrics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENTELEMETRY<|>COMMAND<|>OpenTelemetry is a framework for collecting and sending telemetry data, including metrics, to monitoring services like Geneva Metrics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL DERIVED EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>Local derived events are events generated locally that can be used to publish metrics, though they are less efficient than direct methods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>SERVICE<|>LogsToMetrics is a service that assists in generating metrics from logs when direct submission is not possible.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USAGE QUOTAS<|>PARAMETER<|>Usage quotas are limits set on the LogsToMetrics service to manage its consumption and performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MQL<|>QUERY<|>MQL (Metric Query Language) is a query language used to write queries for extracting metrics from logs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KQL<|>QUERY<|>KQL (Kusto Query Language) is another query language that can be used for querying logs to extract metrics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVERSION RULE<|>CONFIGURATION<|>A conversion rule is a unit of configuration in LogsToMetrics that describes the mapping between Geneva Logs and Geneva Metrics using a query.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS NAMESPACE<|>NAMESPACE<|>The Geneva Logs Namespace is a logical container where logs are stored and from which metrics are extracted.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS TO GENEVA METRICS CONNECTOR<|>GENEVA METRICS<|>The LogsToMetrics connector publishes metrics extracted from logs to Geneva Metrics for processing and analysis.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>LogsToMetrics works on data from Geneva Logs to generate metrics when direct submission is not feasible.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IFX APIS<|>GENEVA METRICS<|>IFx APIs allow for direct publishing of metrics to Geneva Metrics, providing an alternative to using LogsToMetrics.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPENTELEMETRY<|>GENEVA METRICS<|>OpenTelemetry can be used to send metrics directly to Geneva Metrics, similar to IFx APIs.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>USAGE QUOTAS<|>LogsToMetrics has usage quotas that limit its consumption and ensure efficient performance.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MQL<|>CONVERSION RULE<|>MQL is used to write queries that define conversion rules for extracting metrics from logs in the LogsToMetrics service.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KQL<|>CONVERSION RULE<|>KQL can also be used to write queries for conversion rules in the LogsToMetrics service, similar to MQL.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONVERSION RULE<|>GENEVA LOGS NAMESPACE<|>Conversion rules are stored in the Geneva Logs Namespace where the logs are extracted from.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
