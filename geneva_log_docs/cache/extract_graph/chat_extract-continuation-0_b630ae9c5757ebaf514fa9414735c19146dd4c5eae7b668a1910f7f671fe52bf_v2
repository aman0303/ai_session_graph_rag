Any service teams leveraging classic storage accounts are required to migrate their Geneva Logs accounts to GSM (Geneva Storage Management) to meet the JEDI Enterprise Promise. If you have not migrated your Geneva Logs account to GSM, or are experiencing issues, this topic covers reasons and possible solutions for making all of your storage account logs immutable.\n## If you have not migrated your Geneva Logs account to GSM\nIf you're using classic storage accounts or ARM storage accounts not managed by GSM for Geneva logs, you must migrate to GSM. For more information on how to migrate your storage accounts to GSM, see [Migrate to GSM](../../Howtoguides/Manageaccount/MigrateToGSM.md).\n\n### How do I know if GSM is enabled for my Geneva Logs account?\nTo verify if GSM is enabled for your Geneva logs account, navigate to your account in [Jarvis](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/account/logs/configurations). In the **Account** tab you will find **Account Information**. If GSM is enable in the account, you will see a blue banner as displayed in the image:\n\n![GSM (verify GSM)](../../images/VerifyGSM.png \"GSM (verify GSM)\")\n\n\n## If you have migrated your Geneva logs accounts to GSM and receive an action in S360\n\n### Delete legacy resources\nTo complete the GSM migration and ensure compliance with Immutable Logs, you are required to remove the non-GSM legacy resources. **Once the legacy resources are deleted, the data cannot be accessed**. As such, it is highly recommended to wait for 30 days (or the number of days dictated by your data retention policy) after GSM migration was complete before deleting the legacy resources, to allow the data to age out. Please follow the instructions outlined [in this document](../Manageaccount/monikerdelete.md) to delete your legacy resources. \n\n### Error handling\nAs part of enforcing log immutability all storage accounts must be verified. If we cannot verify one or more of your storage accounts, a status of **Forbidden** or **Not Found** is returned. The following paragraphs describe possible solutions based on the status that was received:\n\n#### Forbidden \nIf a status of **Forbidden** is returned when validating your storage accounts, then Geneva does not have access to mark storage containers as immutable.  \n \nAs a result geneva will log the following **error message:**  *\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\"error\":\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\"code\":\"AuthorizationFailed\",\"message\":\"The client '3c2f3efc-0197-4fd5-b566-0e3f07a17f0c' with object id '3c2f3efc-0197-4fd5-b566-0e3f07a17f0c' does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/immutabilityPolicies/read' over scope '/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/Default-Storage-<region>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage account>/blobServices/default/containers/<container name>/immutabilityPolicies/default' or the scope is invalid.
