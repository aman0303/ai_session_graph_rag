The Azure subscription you provided during onboarding will be used by Geneva to provision resources to store your monitoring data as required. Geneva determines the regions where to provision resources based on the MONITORING_GCS_REGION environment variable set on your Monitoring Agent launch environment. \n\n````\nset MONITORING_GCS_REGION=<ARM region name>\n````\n\n### Azure Subscription Management\n\nGeneva also monitors all storage resources for signs of overload and automatically provisions new resources to cope. In order for Geneva to manage your monitoring resources automatically, you need to provide Geneva with enough Azure subscriptions. Don't worry, Geneva also monitors your Azure subscriptions to determine if they are about to run out of resource quota and alert you about them. You can register additional Azure subscriptions under your Geneva Logs account when you receive such an alert. \n\nTo view/register Azure subscriptions, go to Jarvis\\Account\\Logs\\Resources section and view/update as shown below. \n\n![Subscription management][SubscriptionManagementImage]\n\n### Kusto settings and Storage Access Key rotation\n\nIf you want to push your monitoring data from your storage accounts into Kusto, you can specify your Kusto cluster and database in the same Resources section. See below image for an example.\n\n![Kusto settings][KustoSettingsImage]\n\nIn the example above, all events that are stored in __apheleiademoaudit__ Storage Group will get routed to __logandb5__ in __loganid5__. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> - A Storage Group comprises of multiple storage accounts across multiple regions. The example above shows a setup where data from across all regions get routed to a single Kusto database. If you want to route data to regional Kusto clusters, you will need to add more regions and specify Kusto cluster/database values for each region. \n> - When Geneva scales out to a new region, data from the new region will get routed to the Default Kusto cluster/database if no regional setting is specified. \n\nGeneva supports automatic storage key rotation per the rotation frequency you define. Storage keys rotation policies can be set up at individual Storage Group level. To setup up rotation policy:\n\n1. Go to Jarvis\\Account\\Logs\\Resources \n2. Click on the Storage Group of interest\n3. Enter value for Rotation Interval as shown below\n\n![Key Rotation Policy][KeyRotationImage] \n\n### Adding a new Storage Group\n\nGeneva automatically creates three Storage Groups, one each for Diagnostics (suffixed with diag), Audit and Security logs, for every new namespace. This should be sufficient for most purposes. In some cases you may want to create a new Storage Group to route some logically grouped events to a different set of storage accounts. You can create new Storage Group as shown in the example below.\n\n![Create new Storage Group][NewStorageGroup]\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> - Storage Group names __must__ begin with the namespace name (case sensitive)\n> - Newly create Storage Groups must be manually added to your configuration files, and events meant to be routed to the new Storage Group must be manually updated through the _Account_ attribute\n\n<!-- Image links -->\n[SubscriptionManagementImage]: ../images/Subscription.png \"Azure Subscription management\"\n[KustoSettingsImage]: ../images/Streaming.png\n[KeyRotationImage]: ../images/KeyRotationUX.png \"Key rotation policy\"\n[NewStorageGroup]: ../images/NewStorageGroup.png \"Create new Storage Group\"\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva is a service that automatically manages storage resources to meet monitoring needs and provisions resources based on user-defined parameters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING_GCS_REGION<|>PARAMETER<|>MONITORING_GCS_REGION is an environment variable that specifies the Azure region for provisioning monitoring resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AZURE SUBSCRIPTION<|>TENANT<|>An Azure subscription is a container that holds the details of the resources and services that are provisioned in Azure, which Geneva uses to manage monitoring resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUSTO<|>SERVICE<|>Kusto is a data analytics service that allows users to query and analyze large volumes of data, which can be integrated with Geneva for monitoring data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE GROUP<|>CONFIGURATION<|>A Storage Group is a logical grouping of multiple storage accounts across different regions, used to manage and route monitoring data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE ACCESS KEY<|>PARAMETER<|>The Storage Access Key is a credential used to access Azure storage accounts, which can be rotated automatically by Geneva.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROTATION INTERVAL<|>PARAMETER<|>The Rotation Interval is a configurable value that determines how frequently storage keys are rotated within a Storage Group.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARVIS<|>SERVICE<|>Jarvis is a management interface that allows users to view and manage Azure subscriptions and resources related to Geneva.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>MONITORING_GCS_REGION<|>Geneva uses the MONITORING_GCS_REGION parameter to determine where to provision monitoring resources based on the specified Azure region.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>AZURE SUBSCRIPTION<|>Geneva requires Azure subscriptions to provision and manage monitoring resources effectively.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>KUSTO<|>Geneva can push monitoring data to Kusto for analysis and querying, integrating the two services for enhanced data management.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>STORAGE GROUP<|>Geneva automatically creates and manages Storage Groups to organize and route monitoring data across multiple storage accounts.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>STORAGE ACCESS KEY<|>Geneva supports automatic rotation of Storage Access Keys to enhance security for storage accounts.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STORAGE GROUP<|>ROTATION INTERVAL<|>The Rotation Interval parameter is used to define how often the storage keys for a Storage Group should be rotated.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JARVIS<|>AZURE SUBSCRIPTION<|>Jarvis provides a user interface for managing Azure subscriptions, which are essential for Geneva's operation.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
