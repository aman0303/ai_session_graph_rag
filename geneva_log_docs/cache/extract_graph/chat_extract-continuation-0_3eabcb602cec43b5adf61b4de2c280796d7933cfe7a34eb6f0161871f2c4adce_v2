There is an option to use GCS to manage account information, but continue to deploy your own configuration file to your nodes. The downside is that the configuration file you provide MA, might not be exactly in sync with the configuration file you deployed to the Geneva service resulting in possible loss of data. [Here](../../../collect/references/agent/MonAgentLauncher.md#command-line-reference) is a summary of how to use configuration files from your own systems, but see the MonAgentHost and MonAgentLauncher agent documentation for full details.\n\n#### MonAgentHost.exe Usage\n\nInstead of using the -configVersion option described above, use the -configFile option to pass MA the path to your configuration on your system.\n\n#### MonAgentLauncher.exe Usage\n\nDo not set the GenevaConfigVersion setting or the MONITORING_CONFIG_VERSION environment variable in your runtime or environment. Instead use the MonitoringInitConfig runtime setting, or if you use the -useenv option, use the MONITORING_INIT_CONFIG environment variable to pass in your configuration path.\n\n## Tips and tricks\n\nIf you are enabling GCS and using the new config authoring in Jarvis, review the onboarding steps in this section to ensure you understand the new concepts. You do not need to create a new configuration and namespace, but we suggest you start fresh by going through the following steps.\n\nFollow these instructions, if you onboarded to Geneva prior to 2017.\n\n- Deploy the latest version of MA\n    - Make sure you are not trying to enable GCS with an older version of MA. We suggest when you migrate, deploy the latest version to your service rather than doing an update with Agent Explorer.\n    - Learn more to find the latest MA.\n- Increment the major version of your configuration.\n    - The MAs still deployed will use the previous version, and will not be effected by anything you do in your migration. If you first onboarded to MA at version 36 or later you may be able to skip doing the increment.\n\n````\nExample:\n\n<MonitoringManagement version=\"1.0\" namespace=\"TEST\" eventVersion=\"8\" timestamp=\"2011-05-12T20:08:38.0823856Z\">\n\nTO\n\n<MonitoringManagement version=\"1.0\" namespace=\"TEST\" eventVersion=\"9\" timestamp=\"2017-09-12T20:08:38.0823856Z\">\n````\n\n- Delete all of the import files from Jarvis that aren't yours and start fresh.\n    - Use the AgentStandardEvents.xml file from the most current MA version. We suggest you update this import in your service side configuration periodically, since sometimes it does change with a new release of MA. If you use MDS-TOOLS (mds.exe), get the latest version.\n        - When viewed in the latest version of MA, your older imports that were attached to your configuration are now obsolete and empty.\n        - NOTE: If you look at your imports and they already only include AgentStandardEvents.xml plus the new AzSecPack import files, you may be able to skip this step. If you first onboarded to Geneva/MA before 2017, it is likely that what you have deployed is out of date and needs to be refreshed. One hint that you may be very out of date, is if you see files like MonitoringEws*.xml and SecurityStandardEvents*.xml files among your imports.\n- After you've deleted all of the older standard import files and uploaded the newest AgentStandardEvents.xml file (or AgentStandardEventsMin.xml if you are using that), then under \"What To Collect\" --> \"Security Monitoring\" in your Jarvis configuration authoring, you can get the latest AzSecPack imports.\n    - If you aren't using AzSecPack, then you don't need to enable security monitoring and do the previous step, beyond making sure your agent standard events are up to date.\n    - UI Screen shot example. In this example, only the customer root config, AimsVer3v0.xml, and AgentStandardEvents.xml should remain after the cleanup, and AgentStandardEvents.xml should be updated to the version that comes with the latest MA release. There is no AzSecPack in this example.\n\n    ![Configuration Imports](../images/ConfigImportsNew.png)\n\n- You can make sure your azsecpack config imports are up to date by going to the What To Collect tab and select the security tab under that. You can then click on the upgrade button if it shows you are not using the latest imports. If you do not do this, you probably won't see Asm heartabeat events.\n- Save the new configuration to deploy.\n- Make sure when you set the environment variables you use to start the agent, you take the &lt;major>.&lt;minor> version of the configuration you just saved and set the MONITORING_CONFIG_VERSION variable to that number (i.e. set MONITORING_CONFIG_VERSION=8.0).\n\nIf you're a long time MDS/Geneva customer, there is a good chance the configuration imports you have running in the service were uploaded long time ago, from an old version of the Geneva Logs tools or the MA standard location under the MA file in the MA release. These are out of date and at best will add to the CPU and memory load to MA and at worst prevent your configuration from deploying properly or AzSecPack from working properly.\n\nWith GCS, MA is running configs deployed to the Geneva service, so what you see in Jarvis is what MA will run.
