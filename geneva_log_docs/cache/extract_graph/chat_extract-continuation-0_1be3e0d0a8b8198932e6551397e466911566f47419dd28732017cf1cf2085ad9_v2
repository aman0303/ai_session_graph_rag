Retrieve the endpoint: Once the AI model deployment is successful,\nnavigate to your Azure OpenAI Resource. Once inside your OpenAI resource,\nlook for a section on the left-hand menu called \"Keys and Endpoint.\" Click\non it to access the endpoint information. Take a note of the endpoint. You\nwill need the endpoint information for the following steps.\n\n2.2. Look for a section on the left-hand menu called \"Model deployments\",\nclick on the \"Manage Deployments\" button. You will be navigated to the Azure\nOpenAI Studio where you can retrieve the language model and deployment name\ninformation. For example, the deployment name of the below model is\n\"yunlModel\" and the language model is \"gpt-4\". These information will be\nused in the following steps.\n\n![deploymentInfo](../images/deploymentInfo.jpg)\n\n### Create your first commit with AI for string interpolation to compile-time logging source generation\n\nBandishCLI is an AI tool developed by Microsoft Research and M365. Follow the\nsteps below to create your first commit with AI.\n\n1. Check whether your codebase is using the latest stable version of\n[Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging/9.0.0-preview.7.24405.7#versions-body-tab)\npackage. If not, update to use the latest stable version, which has the\nsupport for compile-time logging source generation for all supported\nversions of .NET/.NET Standard/.NET Framework.\n\n2. Install the [prerequisites](https://dev.azure.com/O365Exchange/O365%20Core/_git/AISelfServe?path=/sources/dev/readme.md&version=GBmaster&_a=preview&anchor=prerequisites) and [BandishCLI](https://dev.azure.com/O365Exchange/O365%20Core/_git/AISelfServe?path=/sources/dev/readme.md&version=GBmaster&_a=preview&anchor=installing-bandishcli).\n\n3. Use the parameters you've gotten from step 2. to [connect to your Azure\nOpenAI model](https://dev.azure.com/O365Exchange/O365%20Core/_git/AISelfServe?path=/sources/dev/readme.md&version=GBmaster&_a=preview&anchor=1.-running-bandish-transformation-using-public-scenarios).\n\n4. Follow the steps below to create your first pull request for the ILogger\nlogging migration with the help of AI!\n\n```powershell\n(BandishCLIRun) PS C:\\repos\\azure-sdk-for-net\\sdk> BandishCLI scenario run -o local_write --scenario-name OTel_ILogger_bestPractice_KB --repo-path <LOCAL_REPO_PATH>\n```\n\n> ***NOTE:*** BandishCLI commit_push and pull_request options for large repo\n> transformation will be supported soon!\n\nBelow is an example command of transforming a local repo and create\nAI-generated transformations.\n\n```powershell\n(BandishCLIRun) PS C:\\repos\\azure-sdk-for-net\\sdk> BandishCLI scenario run -o local_write --scenario-name OTel_ILogger_bestPractice_KB --repo-path \"C:\\repos\\azure-sdk-for-net\\sdk\\eventhub\\Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs\\src\\Listeners\\\"\n```\n\nAfter BandishCLI finish transformation, you will see the AI-authored output\nfiles got written to a staging folder locally. You can find the output\ndirectory from the output logs of the BandishCLI run command.\n\n![outputDirectory](../images/outputDirectory.JPG)\n\n5. Use the below command to update your files in the original repo folder with\nthe AI transformed version.\n\n```powershell\n# Update the below param to your <PATH_TO_THE_STAGING_FOLDER_FROM_THE_OUTPUT_OF_BANDISHCLI>.\n# This is from the output of BandishCLI at step 3.4.\n$sourceFolder = \"C:\\Users\\yunl\\staging\\6d1d17fd-642c-45c8-8ff7-8bf6aee10f98\\s\"\n# Update the below param to your <ORIGINAL_REPO_PATH>.\n$destinationFolder = \"C:\\repos\\azure-sdk-for-net\\sdk\\eventhub\\Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs\\src\\Listeners\\\"\n\n$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $sourceFolder -Recurse -Filter \"*_fixed.cs\"\n\nforeach ($file in $files) \n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    Copy-Item -Path $file.FullName -Destination $destinationFolder\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n\n$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $destinationFolder -Recurse -Filter \"*_fixed.cs\"\n\nforeach ($file in $files)\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    $newFileName = $file.Name -replace \"_fixed.cs$\", \".cs\"\n    $newFilePath = Join-Path -Path $file.DirectoryName -ChildPath $newFileName\n\n    if (Test-Path -Path $newFilePath) \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n        Remove-Item -Path $newFilePath -Force\n    \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n\n    Rename-Item -Path $file.FullName -NewName $newFileName\n    Write-Output \"Updated '$newFilePath' to be the AI transformed version.\"\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n```\n\n6. Now you can see the AI-transformed version in your source control system,\nreview it, commit it, and create a PR.\n\n![AICommit](../images/AICommit.JPG)\n\n7.
