Geneva Monitoring collects more than 950PB/day of service logs that are accessible to corp accounts who have default membership in the **REDMOND\\Azure_All_PSV** corp security group, or accounts authorized via Geneva user roles.\n\nHaving access to production Geneva logs via corp accounts is a security vulnerability because these logs may contain sensitive and business critical information. To address this vulnerability, Geneva Monitoring is restricting access to Geneva Logs to authorized accounts only (i.e. *ME/Torus or direct members of a Geneva user role).\n\n## Who is impacted\n\nThis change will impact the following:\n\n- Users who query Geneva Logs through the Jarvis portal or Logs clients (DGrep/DGrep SDK) via a corp account\n- Services who export Geneva data to Kusto/Cosmos using Geneva Integration Services (GDS, Uploaders) via a corp account/application\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe will rollout restricted access to production Geneva Logs over the next few waves.\n\n### SFI Wave 4\n\nIn SFI Wave 4, default access to all Geneva logs via the Redmond/Azure_All_PSV security group will be deprecated.  Users who authenticate to Geneva through this SG will need to obtain direct access to a logs account. Please coordinate with a Geneva account owner/admin to maintain access to logs.\n\n\n### SFI Wave 5+\n\nIn SFI Wave 5 and beyond, we will work on a solution to ensure authorized users have access to Geneva Logs through a secure manner. Further guidance for safely accessing telemetry is pending, and will be shared via this wiki once finalized.\n\n## How to resolve the issue \n\n### Geneva Admins\n\nWe are encouraging Geneva Admins to use this opportunity to review the who has access to your logs, and remove any outdated users, certificates, and security groups.\n\n#### Review your Geneva Logs account user roles\n\n1. Log into the Jarvis Portal with your production account (*ME/Torus)\n2. Navigate to Logs Account Settings -> User Roles\n3. Select the appropriate Logs Endpoint and Logs Account to view all user roles.\n4. Select \"View\" under the \"Users\" column to view all users within the role.\n\n![View Users](../images/GenevaCorpLockdown1.png)\n\n5. Review the list of users for the selected role. Click the checkbox for all outdated accounts and/or users who no longer need access. Select \"Delete\" to remove access. \n\n![Update Users](../images/GenevaCorpLockdown2.png)\n\nMore information on managing user roles can be found on the [Geneva Docs - Manage User Roles](https://eng.ms/docs/products/geneva/logs/howtoguides/manageaccount/access) wiki.\n\n### Geneva Users\n\nEffective March 6, 2025, we will update the Jarvis UI interface to alert users accessing Geneva Logs through the **Redmond/Azure_All_PSV** security group. Users will receive the following notification and will need to contact the logs account owner/administrator to resolve their access permissions. \n\n![DGrep Error Message](../images/GenevaCorpLockdown_DgrepExp.jpg)\n\nTo resolve this, users should connect with a Geneva account admin to request access to the appropriate Geneva account. Although not required *yet*, it is strongly recommended that you use your *ME or Torus production account to access logs. Information on  *ME account setup is available at [MFA Account Creation](https://aka.ms/amecard). \n\n### Service Admins\n\nIf your service owns a Geneva account with an outdated administrator list (i.e. admins which have left the company and/or are no longer on your service), please follow the steps below:\n\n1. [Submit an IcM](https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/create?tmpl=M1y354) on the Geneva Logs Infra Support team to gain access to the Geneva Account.\n2. Follow the steps provided in the \"Geneva Admins\" section above to review your accounts and update as required.\n\nPlease note: Although the Geneva Logs Support team will enable access for the user, the user account maintenance must be carried out by the Geneva Account admin.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I know if I'm authenticating via Redmond/Azure_All_PSV?\n\nAll users who authenticate to Geneva Logs via Redmond/Azure_All_PSV will see a popup message in the Jarvis UI indicating that you are a member of this SG and need to take action. Please contact the admin/owner of the Geneva account to obtain direct access to Geneva logs account. \n\n### How does this affect sending my Geneva log data to downstream data stores (Kusto, Cosmos, etc)?\n\nAll Geneva Integrations and configuration changes (i.e. how/where you export Geneva data) require a production account. Instructions on how to create an account are available at [MFA Account Creation](https://aka.ms/amecard).\n\nIf you have uploaded Geneva Logs to Kusto, please be advised that the Kusto Cluster Hardening effort will impact how/where you export your Geneva data. More information can be found at [Kusto Security Hardening wiki](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/kusto/faq/frosty-speedbump.html).\n\n### I'm a Service Admin and I received an S360 Action Item, but I don't have access to my Geneva Logs MDS account\n\nYou will need to [submit an ICM](https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/create?tmpl=M1y354) to the Geneva Logs Infra Support team to gain access to the MDS account. Additional information is available in the \"Service Admins\" section above.\n\n### Will users require JIT access to view logs?\n\nAt present, JIT is\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3e178c465dadc52f171a297da51eca774085d1f20cacff2ca9a8693863da1ee8_v2"}
