With default container insights daemonset agent ama-logs container limits (**memory: 750Mi and cpu: 500mc**), ~5K logs/sec per node can be achieved on 16 core VM SKU node.

Create an ICM against container insights team (Owning Service: ContainerInsights and Owning Team: ContainerInsightsAgent) to increase resource limits to meet your high Log scale requirements.\n\n  For 40K logs/sec per node , resource limits for ama-logs deamonset container should be **cpu: 3 core and memory: 7GB**. \n\n  b.
