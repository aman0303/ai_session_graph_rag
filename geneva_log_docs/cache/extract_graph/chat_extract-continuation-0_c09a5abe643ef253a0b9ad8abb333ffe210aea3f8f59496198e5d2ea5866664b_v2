These are out of date and at best will add to the CPU and memory load to MA and at worst prevent your configuration from deploying properly or AzSecPack from working properly.\n\nWith GCS, MA is running configs deployed to the Geneva service, so what you see in Jarvis is what MA will run. Pre-GCS, you were using the import files deployed with your MA on your node instances. This means that pre-GCS you were running the correct and most up to date versions of the agent standard import files. Post-GCS, without the steps above, you will revert back to possibly obsolete versions of these files.\n\n## Flighting GCS\n\nOne of the frequently asked question about using GCS is how do I switch my MAs to start operating in GCS mode gradually? An account in GCS mode is fully compatible with the former way of managing configurations and storage resources. You can safely enable GCS mode on your account on the service side and then switch over your MA instances to start using GCS progressively. Follow these steps when you are ready to flight GCS mode in production:\n\n1. Enable GCS mode on your account by making the service-side changes \n2. On the canary scale unit where you want to switch MAs to start using the GCS mode, upgrade MA to >= v36.1.2\n3. Understand the MA launch settings and then follow either step a or b as appropriate:\n    - If you are using MonAgentHost.exe to launch MA use the new GCS command line switches\n    - If you are using MonAgentLauncher.exe to launch MA, set the new GCS environment variable or ACS settings in addition to your existing env variables/settings and set MONITORING_USE_GENEVA_CONFIG_SERVICE variable or UseGenevaConfigService setting to true\n4. Test the monitoring data flow from your canary scale unit to ensure that it is working fine\n5. Roll out the change to the rest of the scale units \n\n<!-- Reference links -->\n[dSMSCerts]: ../../../collect/authentication/dsms.md \"dSMS managed certificates\"\n[AKVCerts]: ../../../collect/authentication/keyvault.md \"Azure KeyVault managed certificates\"\n[MADiskSpace]: ../../../collect/references/agent/Local.md#your disk space needs are more than you think \"MA disk space needs\"\n[MALaunch]:../../../collect/references/start.md \"MonAgentLauncher and MonAgentHost launching\"\n[MonAgentLauncher]:../../../collect/references/agent/MonAgentLauncher.md#command line reference \"MonAgentLauncher command-line reference\"\n[MonAgentHost]:../../../collect/references/agent/MonAgentHost.md#command line reference \"MonAgentHost command-line reference\"\n[Configuration Deployment]:~/logs/manage/configmanagement.md#pushing configuration changes to your service\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS TOOLS<|>SERVICE<|>The Geneva Logs tools are utilities used for managing and monitoring log data within the Geneva service environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MA<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MA (Monitoring Agent) is a component that runs configurations deployed to the Geneva service, responsible for monitoring and reporting data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCS<|>SERVICE<|>GCS (Geneva Configuration Service) is a service that allows for the management of configurations and storage resources in a more efficient manner.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARVIS<|>SERVICE<|>Jarvis is a management interface that displays the configurations and statuses of the Monitoring Agent and other services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCS MODE<|>PARAMETER<|>GCS mode is a configuration setting that enables the Monitoring Agent to operate under the Geneva Configuration Service framework.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONAGENTHOST.EXE<|>COMMAND<|>MonAgentHost.exe is a command-line tool used to launch the Monitoring Agent with specific parameters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONAGENTLAUNCHER.EXE<|>COMMAND<|>MonAgentLauncher.exe is a command-line tool that launches the Monitoring Agent and can be configured with environment variables.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING_USE_GENEVA_CONFIG_SERVICE<|>PARAMETER<|>MONITORING_USE_GENEVA_CONFIG_SERVICE is an environment variable that indicates whether the Monitoring Agent should use the Geneva Configuration Service.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MA<|>GCS<|>The Monitoring Agent (MA) runs configurations that are deployed to the Geneva service, which is part of the GCS framework.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GCS<|>GCS MODE<|>GCS mode is a setting that allows the Monitoring Agent to operate under the Geneva Configuration Service, enhancing its capabilities.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JARVIS<|>MA<|>Jarvis displays the configurations and statuses of the Monitoring Agent, providing insights into its operations.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONAGENTHOST.EXE<|>MA<|>MonAgentHost.exe is used to launch the Monitoring Agent, making it essential for its operation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONAGENTLAUNCHER.EXE<|>MA<|>MonAgentLauncher.exe is another tool for launching the Monitoring Agent, allowing for different configurations based on user needs.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING_USE_GENEVA_CONFIG_SERVICE<|>MA<|>The MONITORING_USE_GENEVA_CONFIG_SERVICE variable determines if the Monitoring Agent will utilize the Geneva Configuration Service for its operations.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
