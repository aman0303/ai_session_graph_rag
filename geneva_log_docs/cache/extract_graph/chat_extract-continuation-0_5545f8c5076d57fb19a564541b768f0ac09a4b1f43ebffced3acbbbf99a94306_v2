This will drive the self-troubleshooting by customer in scenarios like missing data, delay in processing data etc. Also, customers can enable alerts on certain metrics to monitor the error conditions and proactively fix the issues.\n\n>[!Note]  \n>The dashboard is autogenerated for all customers and discoverable in Jarvis under your [Metrics account] > \"GenevaQos\" > \"<- WarmPathQos\".\n>If you don't see any data, that means you may not have enabled the Logs QoS metric publishing for your Logs account. Please follow the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) link to enable the QoS metrics for your Logs.\n\n## Logs QoS metrics breakdown\nThese metrics will provide a detailed view of the data movement per Namespace or AccountMoniker level.\nBelow are the core metrics that are exposed:\n\n### I.

The other sampling types can be viewed on demand.\n>For more details on metrics aggregation check [Metrics aggregation](../../../metrics/concepts/measurements.md)\n\n| Metric | Sampling Type | Description |\n|--------|:-------------:|------------:|\n| Pipeline Ingestion | EventReceivedCount | The event count that corresponds to the number of blobs uploaded by MA.|\n| Pipeline Ingestion | __EventReceivedBytes__ | The un-compressed byte size of the event data.|\n| Pipeline Ingestion | __LatencyMs__ | The wait time in EventHub before ingested by the Logs Pipeline.|\n| Pipeline Ingestion | ThroughputMBps | The ingestion throughput in MBps.|\n\n_Use standard Jarvis widget functionality to view the other sampling types._\n\n__Qos metric Pre-aggregates__\n\n>[!Note]\n> The Qos dashboard currently preselects __Total__ as the dimension, in all the charts. This means that the displayed metric value represents the average across all the Logs Namespaces and account monikers associated with this Metrics account.\n> An account moniker represents a horizontal slice (partition) of the Logs under a particular namespace. A namespace can have multiple monikers, usually one per Azure Region\n\n| Pre-aggregate | Description |\n|--------|------------:|\n| Total | **Default pre-aggregate.** Metric value under this pre-aggregate displays the selected sampling type across all Logs Namespaces & account monikers.|\n| EventNS| **Per Logs Namespace pre-aggregate.** Provides the ability to drill-down and aggregate across specific Logs Namespaces.|\n| EventNS+Moniker | **Per Logs Namespace and Account Moniker pre-aggregate**.
