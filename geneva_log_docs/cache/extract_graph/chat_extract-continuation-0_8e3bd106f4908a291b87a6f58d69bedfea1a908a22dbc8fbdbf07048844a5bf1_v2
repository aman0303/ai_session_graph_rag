Review the Geneva Logs Insights dashboard to undersatnd the biggest namespaces\n\nWhen the [Geneva Logs Insights dashboard](https://aka.ms/glinsights) loads, it defaults to showing data volume for all of the Geneva Logs events for the entire company. Use the parameters at the top of the dashboard to filter down to specific orgs, service groups, services, etc. If you don't have access to this dashboard, request access to 'genevalogsinsights' entitlement in https://aka.ms/coreidentity.\n\n### 2. Review Geneva Ingestion/Processing dashboard to understand most expensive events \n\nThis [dashboard][uberdash] provides visibility on the Logs ingestion and processing volume. Visit this dashboard and specify your Geneva logs namespace and a time window (e.g. 7 days). Use this dashboard to understand the distribution/volume of events in your namespace for logs ingestion and processing.  \n\nThis dashboard shows the following metrics: \n\n#### Ingestion \n\n**Blobs Count:** This shows the top costliest events in terms of number of blobs. This value is directly associated with the Azure Storage operation cost billed against your subscription.  \n**Blobs Count (3P):** This is the same view as before but specifically for 3P/Shoebox events in your namespace. \n**Data volume:** This shows the data volume for events ingested in your namespace.  \n\n \n\n#### Processing \n\nThe data volume of the events being processed increases the cost of each of the below operations.  \n\n**Scrubbing**: This shows the data volume of the events being scrubbed. \n**Logs to Metrics:** This shows the data volume of the logs being converted to metrics.  \n**Cosmos Upload:** This shows the data volume of the logs being uploaded to Cosmos.  \n\n### 3. Review the Agent QoS dashboard to understand most expensive events on agent \nIn addition to impacting your Azure storage operation costs, higher data volume also means you’re paying more on the client at the time of data collection by the agent. Review the \"Top 10 costly event names\" in your Agent QoS dashboard (https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/dashboard/**YOUR-Metrics-Account**/GenevaQos/%25E2%2586%2590%2520AgentQos) in Jarvis to understand your most costly event sources from the perspective of agent.  \n\nHere is an example namespace:  \n\n![AgentQoS](../images/agentqos.png)\n\n### 4. Review your DGrep usage patterns to identify unused events/tables  \nUse the [DGrep Query Count distribution query][dgrep] to understand the DGrep query patterns for your namespace.  This query returns the set of events that have been queried using DGrep in the specified time window.  \n\nYou can use this to determine which tables/events are no longer being used in queries in a specified time period and evaluate if you still to emit that data. Of course, it’s very much possible that such events are still critical to collect and that there were no incidents in the last X weeks that required querying those events. \n \n###\n### 5. Reduce the data volume \nA subset of the ingested logs data is just used in DGrep (Logs Search). Depending on your Logs configuration, the rest of the data is processed further to perform operations such as scrubbing PII data, converting logs to metrics, 3P log scenarios, uploading it to Cosmos or Kusto. The higher the data volume of such events being processed, the higher the cost of the corresponding processing operations. \n\n**For each event with the highest data volume** from the three dashboards/queries above, consider the following approaches to reduce the volume:  \n1. **Is the event still relevant / being used / needed for DGrep or for rest of the processing?** If not, consider removing it. If yes, proceed to the next step.  \n\n2. **Are *all* the processing on the event still needed?**  \n \n\ta. If you are using **Scrubber** for this event, please verify if you still need scrubbing for this event. If not, consider removing this operation.  \n\t\n\tb.
