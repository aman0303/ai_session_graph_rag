09/26/2018\n---\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Geneva Logs pipeline offers a set of standard applications that teams can use to analyze their trace data.\nThese applications include log search (DGrep), PII scrubbing, Cosmos upload, and ADLS upload.\nThe Geneva Extensibility SDK allows teams to implement processors on their streams and extend Geneva services to suit business needs.\n\nAn overview of the Geneva data flow can be found here: [Welcome to Geneva Monitoring](~/getting_started/intro.md).\nBriefly, service logs are collected by the Geneva monitoring agent (MA).\nThe MA is responsible for periodically uploading 1) the logs to Azure Storage and 2) a notification to an Event Hub indicating that a blob has been uploaded and is ready for downstream processing.\nGeneva services such as PII scrubbing, Cosmos upload, and ADLS upload monitor Event Hubs for notifications and act on the same.\n\nThe Extensibility SDK wraps interactions with Event Hubs, Geneva backend, and Azure Storage to reduce the effort involved in accessing your data.\nThe SDK is intended for use in near-real time and streaming scenarios.\nOther options for access to Geneva Logs data is discussed under [Logs](~/logs/intro.md) and [Integrations](~/connectors/intro.md).\n\n# Security Wave Response\n\nWe are aware of the SFI requirement to migrate from SAS/connection strings and move to a more secure, credential-free access method.\nThe Extensibility SDK team is actively working to meet this requirement.\n\nTeams who have received S360 Action Items should apply for an exception via the S360 exception process.\nYou can reference the following ADO item as a known blocker: [Feature 27763709: [ExtSDK] - Security Wave 1 - ID 1.1 Extensibility SDK to support credential-free authentication for offset storage](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/LensSuite/_workitems/edit/27763709).\n\nWe will update customers once the new .NET Standard Extensibility SDK is available.\nA pilot release is targeting late Feb 2025 with a broader release at a future date.\nPlease contact [April Badger (aprilbadger@microsoft.com)](mailto:aprilbadger@microsoft.com) and [Uday Putrevu (udayp@microsoft.com)](mailto:udayp@microsoft.com) for details.\n\nDocumentation on the .NET Standard Extensibility SDK `Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk` is available here:\n\n- [Getting started](gettingstarted.md)\n- [Using the Extensibility SDK](usage.md)\n- [API reference](reference.md)\n- [Migrating from the original Extensibility SDK](migratingfromv1.md)\n- [Release notes](releasenotes.md)\n\nSee also:\n\n- [Extensibility SDK FAQ](~/logs/faq/extensibilityfaq.md)\n- [Extensibility SDK Troubleshooting](~/logs/troubleshooting/extensibilitytshoot.md)\n\nThe Extensibility SDK uses the [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor client library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/messaging.eventhubs.processor-readme) to interact with Event Hubs.\nA familiarity with it is useful to understand the inner workings of the Extensibility SDK.\nMore information is available here:\n\n- [Azure Event Hubs - Event consumers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-consumers)\n- [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor Samples - Processing
