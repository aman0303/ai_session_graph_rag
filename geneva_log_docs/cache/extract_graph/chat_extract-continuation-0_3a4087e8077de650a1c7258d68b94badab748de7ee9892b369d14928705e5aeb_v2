The example assumes that ActivityId is a field in both the events that are joined together.\n\nYou can find more samples in[ this test MA configuration file](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/One/_git/EngSys-MDA-CloudAgent?path=%2Fsrc%2Fconfig%2F2.0%2Finit%2Ftest%2FMaJoinTest2.xml&amp;version=GBmaster&amp;_a=contents).\n\n\nThe join clause matches together records in two events that have the same field values specified using the equals keyword. You can match multiple field values by comma separating the fields names, but both lists of field names on either side of the equals keyword must be the same length. The records derived from the table following the join keyword are the inner records. The outer records are the ones that come from executing the query on the source event. You can only have one join clause in a query.\n\nThe var clause executes a nested query and saves the resultant collection of records for later use. You reference the result of a nested query by using a from clause. You can only have one from clause in a query and it must be the first clause. You cannot have a from or join clause in a nested query. You can have multiple nested queries, however.\n\nThe inner table specified either directly in the join or via the var clause must be of the same store type as the outer table. In these examples the source events are \"local\". Instead of the \"equals\" keyword you can also use \"contains\". You read it as field-outer contains field-inner.\n\nIn the first example, the DebugAuditEvent1 event contains the records that have a matching ActivityId in the audit and debug events. The inner and outer records are queried within the same time range. The resultant fields consist of the unique field names (field names that are not in both source events) plus the  \nTIMESTAMP from the DiagnosticAuditEvent field. If both records have fields with matching names, you can disambiguate them and put them in the result by prefixing them with either \"inner\" or \"outer\".\n\nNote that if the inner collection of records is very large the query can be inefficient to run. To remedy this we recommend that you cut down the number of inner records before making the match as shown in the next example.\n\n          &lt;DerivedEvent source=\"DebugEtwEvent\"\n                        eventName=\"DebugAuditEvent1\"\n                        storeType=\"CentralBond\"\n                        duration=\"PT5M\"&gt;\n            &lt;Query&gt;\n              &lt;![CDATA[\n              join DiagnosticAuditEvent on ActivityId equals ActivityId let AuditTs=inner.TIMESTAMP\n            ]]&gt;\n            &lt;/Query&gt;\n          &lt;/DerivedEvent&gt;\n    \n          &lt;!--\n            You can improve the efficiency of this query by grouping the inner events by the ActivityId,\n            so that you only have one inner record per unique ActivityId.\n            The fields in the result of this query will match the fields of the matched out events (i.e. DebugEtwEvent).\n            You can still do this even if you do care about the inner fields, by adding the ones you care about back\n            using let after the groupby (i.e. let MyAuditField=Last(MyAuditField)). Alternatively you could also shrink\n            the inner collection using the where clause.\n          --&gt;\n    \n          &lt;DerivedEvent source=\"DebugEtwEvent\"\n                        eventName=\"DebugAuditEvent2\"\n                        duration=\"PT5M\"&gt;\n            &lt;Query&gt;\n              &lt;![CDATA[\n              var x = from DiagnosticAuditEvent groupby ActivityId ;\n              join x on ActivityId equals ActivityId\n            ]]&gt;\n            &lt;/Query&gt;\n          &lt;/DerivedEvent&gt;\n\nThe following is an example of how you can use the storeType Binary feature in a pub/sub type of scenario. This is a specialized feature where data is uploaded in blob format and the path to each blob uploaded is queued  to the specified notification queue. For most scenarios we recommend using our storeType=\"CentralBond\" formats.\n\nThe Geneva formats for MA executed derived events are Local and CentralBond. If you derived event is centrally run (i.e. run in the Geneva Logs service) we do not support emitting data in CentralBond format yet, so you have to use Central; the input data coming from MA should be CentralBond, however.\n\nThe message format of the queued message is the following if the blob type is binary (\"MdsBlobCsv\" is substituted  if the type is CSV): <Ms><M><D>QueueName</D><T>UTC Time</T><Cs><C>MdsBlobBinary:ContainerName/IdentityPath/.tmf or .csv file</C></Cs></M></Ms>\"\n\n\n\n    \n         &lt;DerivedEvent source=\"ComputeHourUsageEvent\"\n                        eventName=\"ComputeHourUsageData\"\n                        storeType=\"CentralBond\"\n                        duration=\"PT5M\"&gt;\n            &lt;PostTaskActions&gt;\n              &lt;NotificationQueueAction queueName=\"my-simple-queue1\" queueType=\"Address\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/PostTaskActions&gt;\n            &lt;Query&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;         # This empty query just uploads all of the data.\n          &lt;/DerivedEvent&gt;\n\n\n# Use query variable to build two different types of grouping in one derived event\n\n\nThe following is an example of how you can use query variables to build two different types of grouping in one derived event. In this case all the input rows come from the derived event source. You could also use from clauses in your nested queries to union together data from multiple tables\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOIN CLAUSE<|>COMMAND<|>The join clause is a command used to match records in two events based on specified field values, allowing for data integration and analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAR CLAUSE<|>COMMAND<|>The var clause is a command that executes a nested query and saves the resultant collection of records for later use in the main query.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACTIVITYID<|>PARAMETER<|>ActivityId is a field used in events to identify and match records across different datasets during join operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEBUGAUDITEVENT1<|>EVENT<|>DebugAuditEvent1 is an event that contains records with matching ActivityId in audit and debug events, used for data analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIAGNOSTICAUDITEVENT<|>EVENT<|>DiagnosticAuditEvent is an event that provides detailed records for auditing purposes, often used in conjunction with join operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>SERVICE<|>Derived events are specialized events created from existing events through queries, allowing for enhanced data processing and analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRALBOND<|>NAMESPACE<|>CentralBond is a store type used for managing event data in a centralized manner, facilitating efficient data processing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTEHOURUSAGEEVENT<|>EVENT<|>ComputeHourUsageEvent is an event that tracks the usage of compute hours, often used for billing and resource management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOTIFICATIONQUEUEACTION<|>COMMAND<|>NotificationQueueAction is a command that specifies actions to be taken when certain events occur, such as sending messages to a queue.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOIN CLAUSE<|>ACTIVITYID<|>The join clause utilizes the ActivityId parameter to match records across events, establishing a direct relationship between them.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VAR CLAUSE<|>JOIN CLAUSE<|>The var clause can be used in conjunction with the join clause to execute nested queries and enhance data retrieval capabilities.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEBUGAUDITEVENT1<|>DIAGNOSTICAUDITEVENT<|>DebugAuditEvent1 is related to DiagnosticAuditEvent as it contains records that match based on the ActivityId field.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>DEBUGAUDITEVENT1<|>Derived events are created from existing events like DebugAuditEvent1, allowing for further analysis and processing of data.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPUTEHOURUSAGEEVENT<|>NOTIFICATIONQUEUEACTION<|>ComputeHourUsageEvent can trigger NotificationQueueAction to send messages to a queue based on event occurrences.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRALBOND<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>CentralBond is a store type used for derived events, indicating a relationship in data management and processing.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
