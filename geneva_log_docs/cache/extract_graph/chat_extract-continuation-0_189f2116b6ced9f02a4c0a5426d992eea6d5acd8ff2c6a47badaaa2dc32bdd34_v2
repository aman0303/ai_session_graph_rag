You will still have to delete these resources manually from the Azure subscription they belong to. You may have to wait until the [immutability policy](../Compliance/ImmutableLogs.md) expires before you can delete the storage account. Before deleting, make sure no data is still needed in these resources. \n\n>[!Note]\n>If you delete a moniker, the logs stored in the assocciated resources will no longer be available to query via DGrep.\n\n## How to delete a Geneva Storage Management (GSM) moniker\n[GSM](../../Concepts/WhatIsGsm.md) manages monikers and resources on your behalf. All GSM-managed resources (storage accounts and Event Hubs) are created with the same [naming convention](../../concepts/WhatIsGsm.md#gsm-managed-monikers), and their names start with the prefix \"gsm\". If your Geneva Logs account is [GSM-enabled or in Hybrid mode](./gsm_gcsenabled.md), you can see your GSM-managed monikers and resources by navigating to the **Resources** tab in your Logs account view in the Geneva Portal, and then click on **Legacy Resource View**.\n\n![GSM Resources](../images/GSMResources.png)\n\n\n![GSM Monikers](../images/GSMMonikers.png)\n\n### Follow these steps to delete GSM-managed monikers:\n>[!Note]\n>These steps apply only to GSM managed monikers. You can identify these monikers by the storage accounts and Event Hubs nameing convention, which starts with the prefix \"gsm\". \n\nIf the moniker you wish to delete is referenced in any deployed configuration, and you no longer require the config or the data in the moniker, you can safely delete the config and then delete the moniker or the storage group (either through [Geneva portal](#to-delete-a-moniker-in-geneva-portal), or via [powershell tools](#to-delete-a-moniker-via-cli)). \n\nIf the moniker you wish to delete is *not* referenced in any deployed configuration, you can safely delete the moniker or the storage group (either through [Geneva portal](#to-delete-a-moniker-in-geneva-portal), or via [powershell tools](#to-delete-a-moniker-via-cli)). \n\nOtherwise, follow these steps to deactivate and delete the moniker: \n\n1. Download the latest version of [MDS tools](../../Resources/Downloads.md). \n2. Deactivate the moniker you wish to delete. Deactivating a moniker will keep the logs stored in this moniker available for query in case there is an issue, but it will ensure that no new telemetry is emitted to it.\n```  \nmds.exe resourcemanagement <endpoint> -command:deactivateMoniker -mdsAccount:<mdsAcccount> -monikerName:<monikerName> -deactivateMoniker:True [-clientcert:X] \n```\n* *clientcert* is an optional parameter. \n\nIf after the moniker is deactivated the Monitoring Agent requires a new moniker in that region, GSM will [automatically provision](../../concepts/whatisgsm.md#how-does-gsm-detect-that-i-need-more-resources-within-a-region) a new one. \n\n>[!Note]\n>If you still need the data that was stored in this moniker available to query, you can leave it in the deactivated state until you no longer need the data. Otherwise, please wait 48 hours before deleting the moniker and the associated Storage Account and Event Hub, to avoid any data loss that is hard to recover.\n\n3. When you no longer need the data, delete the moniker from your Geneva Logs account, either through [Geneva\n](#to-delete-a-moniker-in-geneva-portal), or via [powershell tools](#to-delete-a-moniker-via-cli).  \n\n## How to delete non-GSM monikers\nIf your account is [non-GSM enabled](./gsm_gcsenabled.md), you can see the list of your monikers and resources by navigating to the **Resources** tab in your Logs account view in the Geneva Portal.  \n\n![Legacy Moniker View](../images/LegacyMonikers_new.png)\n\nYou can delete the moniker from your Logs account, either through [Geneva Portal](#to-delete-a-moniker-in-geneva-portal), or via [powershell tools](#to-delete-a-moniker-via-cli). Since the moniker you are deleting is not managed by GSM, you will have to provision a new moniker to replace it, if you require one in the region. \n\nIf the moniker you are trying to delete is referenced in any deployed configuration, you have to update the configuration file to remove all references to the moniker before you can complete the operation.  \n\n## To delete a moniker in Geneva Portal\n* Navigate to your Geneva Logs account page in Geneva Portal by clicking **Account** and then **Logs Account Settings** in the left side navigation bar. \n* Select your **Logs Endpoint** and **Logs Account**.\n* Select the **Resources** tab. If your account is GSM-enabled or in Hybrid mode, click on **Legacy Resource View** to see the list of monikers. \n* Click the **checkbox** for any moniker you wish to delete, and then click on the **Delete** button. \n\n![Delete Moniker](../images/GSMMonikers_delete.png)\n\n## To delete a moniker via CLI \n\n\nYou can find more comprehensive information about usage of Geneva PowerShell Cmd\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MONIKER<|>SERVICE<|>A moniker is a resource in Geneva Logs that associates storage accounts and Event Hub resources with the logs account, allowing for organized management of log data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>TENANT<|>The Geneva Logs account is a user account that manages log data and associated resources within the Geneva Logs service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT HUB<|>SERVICE<|>Event Hub is a service that ingests and processes large amounts of data in real-time, often used in conjunction with Geneva Logs for telemetry data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE ACCOUNT<|>SERVICE<|>A storage account is a service that provides storage capabilities for data, including logs, in the Azure cloud environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMMUTABILITY POLICY<|>PARAMETER<|>The immutability policy is a setting that prevents data from being modified or deleted until a specified time period has expired.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GSM<|>SERVICE<|>GSM (Geneva Storage Management) is a service that manages monikers and resources automatically on behalf of the user, ensuring efficient resource allocation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA PORTAL<|>SERVICE<|>The Geneva Portal is a web interface for managing Geneva Logs accounts, resources, and configurations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MDS TOOLS<|>COMMAND<|>MDS tools are command-line tools used for managing resources in Geneva Logs, including deactivating and deleting monikers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWER SHELL TOOLS<|>COMMAND<|>PowerShell tools are command-line utilities that allow users to manage Azure resources and perform operations on Geneva Logs accounts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>A moniker is associated with a Geneva Logs account, linking the storage and Event Hub resources to the logs account for management purposes.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER<|>STORAGE ACCOUNT<|>A moniker disassociates the storage account when deleted, indicating a direct relationship between the two entities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER<|>EVENT HUB<|>The moniker is linked to Event Hub resources, which are used for telemetry data associated with the logs account.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER<|>IMMUTABILITY POLICY<|>The immutability policy may affect the deletion of a moniker, as it prevents data modification until expiration.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>MONIKER<|>GSM manages monikers and resources, indicating a strong relationship in resource management.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA PORTAL<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>The Geneva Portal is used to manage the Geneva Logs account and its associated resources.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MDS TOOLS<|>MONIKER<|>MDS tools are used to deactivate and delete monikers, indicating a direct operational relationship.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POWER SHELL TOOLS<|>MONIKER<|>PowerShell tools can be used to delete monikers, showing a functional relationship in resource management.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
