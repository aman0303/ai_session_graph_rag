This means the result set may contain uncurbed data and scrubbed data. \n> For example, let’s assume the filed ‘name’ is tagged as in scope data and the query runs on EUDB data and US data. The result table will be:\n> <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->\n\n| Name |\n\n---------\n\n| Tom Jones |\n| Marry J. Blige |\n| Scrubbed |\n| Scrubbed |\n| Elton John |\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->\n\nIt is important to be cognizant of this change as client side/subsequent queries may show undesirable results – for example running a dcount function in DGrep UI will produce an inaccurate result.\n\nNote the scrubbed data in this data set:\n\n![scrubbed image](../images/dgrepSchremsScrubbed.PNG)\n\nWe have added UI indications to highlight the fact the data was scrubbed:\n\n![scrubbed image Indication](../images/dgrepSchremsScrubbedIndication.PNG)\n\nFor DGrep SDK, indication for scrubbing can be received programmatically:\n\n![scrubbed image Indication SDK](../images/dgrepSchremsScrubbedIndicationSDK.PNG)\n\n### Query doesn’t contain in-scope data\n\nIf the query doesn’t contain any data tagged as ‘in scope’, the query will execute and return a full set of result.\n\n## Getting your EUDB data using VDI\n\nIn case the actual in scope data is needed to complete the task, DGrep will allow access to a full result set of ‘in scope’ EUDB data through centrally managed, specifically assigned VDI machines.\n\nIf your DGrep queries do not require SAW access then go to the vDesktop EUDB URL: [Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/Security_Tools_Services/SitePages/WindowsVirtualDesktop/Windows-Virtual-Desktop.aspx#what-is-wvd)\n\nIf the queries require elevated access then using SAW and the JIT flow you will be redirected to the EUDB flow.\n\nOnce connected using SAW and JIT DGRep URL will automatically direct you to the right URL.\n\n## Adjacent apps and integrations  \n\nDGrep and DGrep APIs are used in several adjacent apps and integrations like:\n\n1. GHS\n2. Incident automation\n3. ICM\n4. Other proprietary integrations\n\nPlease note that **all the integrations** are impacted by the forementioned changes.\n\nIt is recommended to test your integrations and queries and make sure scrubbing doesn’t impact critical tasks.\n\nNote: querying the full data is only available through VDI, API is not supported.\nThe reason for this is that API produces a data set that is no longer controlled by the system. This means that if the data leaves DGrep boundaries it is no longer controlled by DGrep and we can’t ensure Schrems II compliance.\n\n## Testing Schrems II for DGrep \n\nBefore the team rolls out our PROD solution that will impact all systems, we encourage users and groups to test Schrems II for DGrep using our DGrep-INT environment.\n\nYou may use our DGrep-INT UI experience in [Logs | Jarvis-Int (microsoftgeneva.com)](https://jarvis-int-west.microsoftgeneva.com/logs/dgrep) and our DGRep-INT endpoint in http://dgrepv2-frontend-ppe.trafficmanager.net to fully test DGrep with Schrems II support.\n\nPlease note, the DGRep-int instance uses the same tags as the PROD instance so you don’t have to double tag or invest in additional work.\n\n## Providing feedback and reporting issues \n\nNo implementation is perfect, if you found a bug or have feedback please use this link to submit it: https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_workitems/create/Bug?templateId=8bf3325d-08ff-4705-a7b1-9cd5c9c6e921&ownerId=cd34c3fb-8eb5-426a-a6ea-a29fb070f381\n\nFor bugs: please provide a full repro of the bug so we can troubleshoot easily.\n\nFor feedbacks please include as much data as possible so we can address the feedback.\n\n## Submitting an exception request \n\nIn some cases, you may want to exclude your data set from Schrems II.\n\nThese cases are handled using dedicated exception processes.\n\nPlease follow these links to initiate your exception process:\n\n  1.
