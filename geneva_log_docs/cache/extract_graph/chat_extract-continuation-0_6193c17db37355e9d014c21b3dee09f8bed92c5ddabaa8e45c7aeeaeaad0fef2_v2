[Enable GSM](../Manageaccount/MigrateToGsm.md) on your logs namespaces.\n2. Update your logs configuration to choose the [Geo Isolated moniker failover option](../Manageaccount/FailoverMonikers.md). \n\n## Tagging your data\n\nMuch like GDPR, Schrems II requires the data to be tagged as ‘in scope’ so the system knows what fields to protect and scrub and what fields are ‘safe’ to show outside of the EUDB.\n\nLuckily, the Schrems II and GDPR tags align completely, so we have opted for using your existing GDPR tags for Schrems II.\n\nTo learn how to tag your data please refer to this document:  [document](https://eng.ms/docs/products/geneva/logs/howtoguides/compliance/gdpr).\n\nFor additional question about tagging please contact gdprask@microsoft.com and not the DGgrep team.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Synchronization between DGrep and Data Grid tags mostly takes a few hours, and can even take a few days. Don't expect to see the scrubbing immediately after tags where updated.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Schrems II tags are identical to GDPR tags, this means that your GDPR tags will also work for Schrems II, if your data is tagged, no additional work is needed on your end.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are seeing an untagged column being scrubbed please verify both in [Data Grid](https://datagrid.microsoft.com/CatalogManager/DataDiscovery) and in [Data Catalog](https://datastudio.msftcloudes.com/#/entities) that your column is not tagged as in-scope.\n\n### Opt-in policy\n\nThe base assumption of Schrems II is identical to GDPR. This means the system will not protect data that is not tagged appropriately.\n\nIt is recommended that if your data is not tagged at all, that you consider running a script that tags all data as in scope and then undergo a process of ‘clearing’ data.\n\n## DGrep internal changes\n\nTo support Schrems II DGrep will introduce the following changes:\n\n1. DGrep deploys and manages an EUDB endpoint to manage and run all EUDB queries. \n2. DGrep integrates with Data studio to obtain tagging data.  \n3. DGrep has created a scrubbing mechanism that will scrub data tagged as ‘in scope’ and queried outside of the EUDB. \n\n## Query experience and scrubbed data\n\n### Running a query from within the EUDB\n\nThe EUDB for this case is defined as specific VDI machines cleared for EUDB data and managed by Global.\n\nMore about VDI machines may be found in this article: Getting your EUDB data using VDI.\n\nWhen querying from within the EUDB, the full data from the query is presented. Since the data is processed and stored within the EUDB, no limitations apply on this data, your DGrep experience will remain unchanged while using the VDI machines.\n\n### Running a query outside the EUDB\n\nIn this case, the ‘outside of EUDB’ definition refers to every machine and caller that is not the specific VDI machines cleared for EUDB.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The actual physical location of the caller is not applicable for the EUDB definition at this point. \n\n### Query contains in-scope data\n\nIf a query contains data that is tagged as ‘in scope’ and is executed outside of the EUDB\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCHREMS II<|>EVENT<|>Schrems II is a legal framework that governs the processing and storage of personal data from the European Union, requiring compliance for data handling practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREP<|>SERVICE<|>DGrep is a service that scrubs data tagged as 'in scope' for queries executed from outside of the EUDB, ensuring compliance with Schrems II regulations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Logs is a service that provides logging capabilities and is integrated with DGrep to manage data storage and processing in compliance with Schrems II.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUDB<|>NAMESPACE<|>EUDB refers to the European Database, which is a secure environment for processing and storing data in compliance with EU regulations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GSM<|>PARAMETER<|>GSM (Geneva Storage Management) is a feature that ensures Geneva logs are stored in the appropriate geographical location and supports smart failover.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VDI MACHINES<|>PARAMETER<|>VDI machines are pre-approved, secured virtual desktop infrastructure that users must utilize to access in-scope data from the EUDB.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEO ISOLATED MONIKER FAILOVER OPTION<|>CONFIGURATION<|>The Geo Isolated moniker failover option is a configuration setting that ensures data is stored in compliance with geographical regulations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GDPR TAGS<|>PARAMETER<|>GDPR tags are labels used to identify data that requires protection under the General Data Protection Regulation, which align with Schrems II tagging requirements.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>DGrep integrates with Geneva Logs to ensure that data handling complies with Schrems II regulations by scrubbing in-scope data.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>EUDB<|>DGrep manages and runs queries through the EUDB endpoint to ensure compliance with Schrems II when processing data.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>GSM is required for Geneva Logs to ensure that data is stored in the appropriate geographical location, complying with Schrems II.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VDI MACHINES<|>DGREP<|>Users must utilize VDI machines to access in-scope data through DGrep, ensuring compliance with Schrems II regulations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDPR TAGS<|>DGREP<|>GDPR tags are used to identify data that is in scope for scrubbing by DGrep, aligning with Schrems II requirements.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEO ISOLATED MONIKER FAILOVER OPTION<|>GSM<|>The Geo Isolated moniker failover option is part of the GSM configuration to ensure compliance with geographical data storage regulations.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
