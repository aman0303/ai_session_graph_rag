This section will provide information about the specific operations performed and where they were executed.\n\n   - **Step 2:** Additionally, if in the **Some Failing Combinations**, it indicates that the MdsEnvironment is **Diagnostics Prod**, you can view the DGrep logs enrichment provided with the IcM. \n   \n        Example of a DGrep Enrichment:![MdsAlertingEnrichment][MdsAlertingEnrichment]\n   \n        Depending on the type of operation, focus on specific columns:\n    \n        - For **Configuration Operation**, look at Config Service Enrichment:\n            - Operation\n            - ConfigId\n            - UserName\n\n        - For **User Role Operation**, focus on Account Service Enrichment:\n            - OperationName\n            - MdsAccount\n            - UserName\n            - Arguments\n   \n   - **Step 3:** If the operation occurs in an MdsEnvironment that is not Diagnostics Prod, no actual enrichments will be displayed. However, you can still click on the Config Service Enrichment (for Config) or Account Service Enrichment (for User Role) links to access the DGrep logs. Remember to change the Endpoint to the MdsEnvironment you obtained from **Some Failing Combinations** and reselect namespaces Mds/mds and WarmPath. If no results appear in the logs, try extending the time range.\n        \n        ![MdsAlertingNoEnrichment][MdsAlertingNoEnrichment]\n\n\n### How can I identify who made the changes?\n\nThe **UserName** field in the DGrep logs enrichment represents the credential used to perform this operation. Typically, this credential is owned by your service, indicating that the request was made directly to the MDS service. However, there are cases, such as EV2 deployment and certain operations in Jarvis, where the request is initially made to GCS and then redirected to MDS. In such cases, a Geneva-specific certificate will appear as the UserName.\n\nFor example, you will see Managed:d831e66b08ffa3b0d4b6fa12184c9b59.metricsclient.geneva.core.windows.net for Diagnostic Prod. Click [here][GcsToMdsAuthCert] for other gcstomdsauth* certificates we use in each environment and their identity.\n\nIt will require additional steps to identify the actual operator in this case. Here are the steps if needed:\n\n1. Gather the **ActivityID** and **PreciseTimeStamp** from the DGrep enrichment table or the DGrep logs from clicking on the enrichment link.\n\n    ![TimeAndActivity][TimeAndActivity]\n2. Open this DGrep [link][GcsActivityId]. \n3. Replace the Endpoint by the actual MdsEnvironment you obtained from previous steps. Select Mds/mds and WarmPath as the namespaces. \n    \n    ![DgrepSelection][DgrepSelection]\n4. Replace the search time range by **PreciseTimeStamp**.\n\n    ![TimeRange][TimeRange]\n5. And in the Filter Conditions, replace <Your_Activity_ID> by the actual **ActivityID**. For example, if your activity ID is 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000, you should update the filtering conditions as follows:\n    \n    ![MdsAlertingFiltering][MdsAlertingFiltering]\n\n    The search result will contain two columns: GcsActivityId and MdsActivityId.\n6. Finally, replace the Filtering Conditions with the actual GcsActivityId. Also, make sure to remove any pre-generated queries in the Client Query section.\n    \n    ![MdsAlertingFiltering2][MdsAlertingFiltering2]\n    \n\n### What should I do if I didn't make these changes or suspect unauthorized access?\n\nMake sure you have read through the above TSG.
