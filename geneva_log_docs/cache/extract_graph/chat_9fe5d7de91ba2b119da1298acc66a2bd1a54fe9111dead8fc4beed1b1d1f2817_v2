Therefore, before enabling selective indexing, you should go through the following steps:\n\n1. Create a Kusto cluster and enable [ingestion from Geneva](../../../../connectors/Geneva%20to%20Kusto/overview.md). DGrep is not connected to GDS, new customers should still follow the GDS path for Kusto ingestion and on top of that complete the prerequisites step of the legacy path.\n1. If the kusto cluster's URL is https://clusterName.**region**.kusto.windows.net, go to [Jarvis > Actions > AzureLogAnalyticsControlPlane > DGrep > AddKustoClusterUrlOverride](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/748E392A?genevatraceguid=80ced77c-3b3f-4d4b-8db2-bbd32bc6cfb5), enter your kusto Cluster's URL in *Kusto URL Override* field. The update might take a few minutes. For any issue, please open ticket to [DGrep](https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/create?tmpl=qD3J3Q).\n1. Authorize DGrep to read from your Kusto database. This can be done by running the following command in your cluster:\n   ```javascript\n   .add database <database name> viewers ('dstsapp=dgrep.prod.pipeline.msftcloudes.com')\n   ```\n\n## Selective Indexing on Events\n\nLet's suppose that you want to enable selective indexing on columns UserId and ActivityId of an event called Operation.\n\n### 1. Create a derived event\n\nCreate a derived event with `source=\"Operation\", storeType=\"CentralBond\" and whereToRun=\"Local\"`. This event will contain the index for event Operation. You can give this event any name -- in the example below, we are calling it OperationIndex.\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Operation\" eventName=\"OperationIndex\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" whereToRun=\"Local\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n\n### 2. Add query to the event\n\nAdd the following query to the derived event definition.\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Operation\" eventName=\"OperationIndex\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" whereToRun=\"Local\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n  <Query><![CDATA[\n    groupby Identity(), UserId, ActivityId\n    let __EndTime__ = EndOfQueryInterval()\n  ]]></Query>\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n\n### 3. Add Identity definitions\n\nIf Operation is an IFX event, add identity column definitions to the derived event query:\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Operation\" eventName=\"OperationIndex\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" whereToRun=\"Local\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n  <Query><![CDATA[\n    let Tenant = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MONITORING_TENANT\")\n    let Role = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MONITORING_ROLE\")\n    let RoleInstance = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MONITORING_ROLE_INSTANCE\")\n    groupby Identity(), UserId, ActivityId\n    let __EndTime__ = EndOfQueryInterval()\n  ]]></Query>\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n\n### 4. Add EventStreamingAnnotation\n\n* Add an EventStreamingAnnotation called SelectiveIndexing to the Operation event. Please make sure that the regular expression on the EventStreamingAnnotation element matches only the Operation event.\n  Also Add the derived event name in the SelectiveIndex annotation content.\n\n    ```xml\n    <EventStreamingAnnotation name=\"^Operation$\">\n    <SelectiveIndexing>\n        <Content>OperationIndex</Content>\n    </SelectiveIndexing>\n    </EventStreamingAnnotation>\n    ```\n\n* Add an EventStreamingAnnotation to the DerivedEvent that will send it to your Kusto table.\n\n    ```xml\n    <EventStreamingAnnotation name=\"^OperationIndex$\">\n      <LogAnalytics>\n        <Content>LogAnalyticsContent</Content>\n      </LogAnalytics>\n    </EventStreamingAnnotation>\n    ```\n\n### 5. Update version\n\nIncrement the namespace configuration version. This step is necessary to ensure that the index will be only be used to search new data.\n\n### 6. Upload the configuration\n\nUpload the new configuration to Geneva and deploy it to your service.\n\n## Selective Indexing on derived events\n\nEnabling selective indexing on derived events requires a special treatment and can only be done by manually editing the namespace configuration. \n\nSuppose that Operation is a derived event with source event Foo:\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Foo\" eventName=\"Operation\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n  <Query><![CDATA[\n    where OperationName != \"\"\n  ]]></Query>\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n\nIn order to enable selective indexing on event Operation, please perform the following steps.\n\n### 1. Create a new derived event\n\nCreate a new derived event with `source = Foo` and `storeType = Local`. Let's call it OperationLocal.\n\n### 2. Copy over the query\n\nCopy the derived event query from Operation to OperationLocal.\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Foo\" eventName=\"OperationLocal\" storeType=\"Local\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n  <Query><![CDATA[\n    where OperationName != \"\"\n  ]]></Query>\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n### 3. Edit the original derived event\n\nChange Operation's definition so that it has `source=\"OperationLocal\"` and an empty query:\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"OperationLocal\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9fe5d7de91ba2b119da1298acc66a2bd1a54fe9111dead8fc4beed1b1d1f2817_v2"}
