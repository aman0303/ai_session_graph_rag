Also, note that partition and row keys are not used in the CentralBond format, since that is a blob format.\n\nThe let clauses for overriding the partition and row keys must be at the start of the query.\n\n```    \n          <DerivedEvent duration=\"PT15M\"\n              overwriteDestTable = \"true\"\n              whereToRun = \"Local\"\n              retryTimeout=\"PT0M\"\n              noMdsGc=\"true\"\n              eventName=\"MAStatusReportTable\">\n            <Query>\n              <![CDATA[\n                let PartitionKey=FakeTimeStampTicksString()\n                let RowKey=GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MA_HEARTBEAT_IDENTITY\")\n                let HeartbeatIdentity = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MA_HEARTBEAT_IDENTITY\")\n                let ConfigFileMD5 = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MA_CONFIGFILE_MD5\")\n                let TargetConfigFileMD5 = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MA_CONFIGFILE_MD5\")\n                let LastUpdateTime = EndOfQueryInterval()\n                let Context = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"DEFAULT_MA_ACCOUNT_NAME\")\n              ]]>\n            </Query>\n          </DerivedEvent>\n```\n\nThe following is an example of how you can use the external derived events feature. This feature is only available for centrally run derived events. Each source table matched by the external source regex is queried and processed separately. Three new attributes were added to derived events to support this feature:\n\n\n- externalSource: Specifies a regex for the external table name. For example, for the external tables MdsIisLogWebSiteOneVer2v0 and MdsIisLogWebSiteTwoVer2v0  you can use the following regex: MdsIisLogWebSite.\\*\n- externalSourceNumVersions: optional.   0 means do an exact match on the source, which should include the version suffix; 1 means latest version only; 2 means second latest version only, etc.\n- queryDelay: recommended - specifies how long to delay running the event derived from the external tables. When setting this attribute you need to make sure that the query delay value is large enough to allow for all of the source data to be populated in the source table.\n- For example, if this task runs every 5 minutes and the source task runs every 5 minutes, then the PT20M query delay means that the task that runs for the data between 1:00 PM and 1:05 PM starts at 1:20 PM.\n\n```    \n          <DerivedEvent externalSource=\"MdsIisLogWebSite.*\"\n
