We have two useful methods at our disposal to diagnose and troubleshoot calls to DGrep SDK:\n\n1. Client side troubleshooting with DGrep client logs\n1. Server side troubleshooting with QueryStatus\n\n## Prerequisites\n1. **[Optional]** Install [PerfView](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/blob/main/documentation/Downloading.md) on the machine where your program runs.\n\n## Client side troubleshooting\n\n### 1. Common exceptions\n\nHere is a list of the most common exceptions thrown by the DGrep SDK and how to resolve them.\n\n* **No private key found in client authentication certificate**\n  \n  The certificate loaded by your application does not contain a private key. This happens either because the certificate is installed on the machine without a private key or because the certificate is in the LocalMachine store and the application is being executed without administrative privileges.\n  \n  To verify whether the certificate installed on the machine has a private key, run the following Powershell command:\n  ```powershell\n  (Get-Item Cert:\\LocalMachine\\my\\<thumbprint>).HasPrivateKey\n  ```\n\n* **CryptographicException: Invalid provider type specified**\n\n  This usually happens when trying to authenticate using a Windows Hello PIN certificate. To fix this, please add the following element to your executable's `App.config` file:\n\n  ```xml\n  <configuration>\n    <runtime>\n      ...\n      <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.IdentityModel.DisableCngCertificates=false\" />\n    </runtime>\n  </configuration>\n  ```\n\n* **MDS call … failed. Request url: …, StatusCode: Unauthorized, ResponsePhrase: Unauthorized**\n\nThe certificate provided to the DGrep SDK is not authorized in any user role in the selected Geneva Logs endpoint. Make sure that the certificate is correctly authorized in a user role that has read access to the events being queried ([instructions](~/collect/authentication/keyvault.md#use the akv certificate in geneva logs)). Also ensure that the correct Geneva Logs endpoint was provided in the query input.\n\n* **System.ArgumentException: The event filter matches no tables or the user has access to none of the matching tables.**\n\nThis means either that the events in the query input do not exist or that the certificate provided to the DGrep SDK is not authorized to read those events. Make sure that there are no spelling or casing errors in the event names and namespaces. Also make sure that the certificate is correctly authorized in a user role that has read access to the events being queried ([instructions](~/collect/authentication/keyvault.md#use the akv certificate in geneva logs)).\n\n* **HTTP Forbidden - The certificate is not in the list of authorized certificates**\n  \n  The certificate provided to the DGrep SDK is an unmanaged certificate (in other words, it is not a OneCert certificate). DGrep only supports certificates issued by OneCert and managed by AKV or dSMS ([more details](../References/DGrepSDK/sdk.md#authentication)).\n\n* **System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException: A task was canceled.**\n\n  This indicates a timeout in a request to the Geneva Logs or DGrep services. This could point to an issue in one of those services or an issue in the client side. Please verify whether there are any networking issues on the client machine. If you believe there is a server side issue, please [contact us](../../support/supportpolicy.md). It might be useful to collect client side logs, as explained in the next section.\n\n### 2. DGrep client logs\n\nThe DGrep SDK logs detailed information about queries, including errors and latencies, using the *ETW provider `Microsoft-Geneva-DGrep-Client`*. \n\n> [!Important]\n> You need to perform atleast one of the following actions to view the logs.\n\n* Those logs can be collected using [PerfView](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28567), by setting additional providers to `*Microsoft-Geneva-DGrep-Client` in the \"Collect\" dialog.\n\n* Alternatively, you can register the manifest on the machine where the SDK is executed by using the command below. Once this is done, these events will be visible in the **Windows Event Logs**. The provider manifest and assembly files are included in the MDAC nuget package under `lib\\net40`.\n\n    ```bash\n    wevtutil.exe im MdsDataAccessClient.Microsoft-Geneva-DGrep-Client.etwManifest.man /rf:\"MdsDataAccessClient.Microsoft-Geneva-DGrep-Client.etwManifest.dll\" /mf:\"MdsDataAccessClient.Microsoft-Geneva-DGrep-Client.etwManifest.dll\"\n    ```\n\nFinally, since these are ETW events, MA can upload them to Geneva.\n\n## Server side troubleshooting\n\n### 1. Query result status\nDGrep exposes additional information about a query that can be used to monitor its progress and detect issues. In the example below, we are inspecting the properties of the `QueryStatus` object returned by `DGrepClient.GetRowSetResultAsync`.\n\n```C#\nusing (var client = new DGrepClient(DGrepEndpoint, ClientCertificate))\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    RowSetResult result = await client.GetRowSetResultAsync(input, cancellationToken);\n    var status = result.QueryStatus.Status;\n    var processedBytes = result.QueryStatus.ProcessedBlobSize;\n    var failedBytes = result.QueryStatus.FailedBlobSize;\n    var queryId = result.QueryId;\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n```\n\n*`RowSetResult.QueryStatus.Status` is a `string` which describes the status of a query.* \n\nIt can have one of the following values:\n\n* *Completed:*\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DGREP SDK<|>SERVICE<|>The DGrep SDK is a software development kit that allows developers to interact with the Geneva Logs service for logging and monitoring purposes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIENT AUTHENTICATION CERTIFICATE<|>PARAMETER<|>The client authentication certificate is used to authenticate the client application to the DGrep SDK, ensuring secure communication and access to resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUERYSTATUS<|>COMMAND<|>QueryStatus is a command used to retrieve the status of a query executed against the DGrep SDK, providing insights into its progress and results.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Logs is a logging service that collects and manages log data, which can be accessed and queried through the DGrep SDK.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ETW PROVIDER<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>The ETW provider Microsoft-Geneva-DGrep-Client is a monitoring agent that logs detailed information about queries made through the DGrep SDK, including errors and latencies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERFVIEW<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>PerfView is a performance analysis tool that can be used to collect and analyze logs from the DGrep SDK, helping diagnose issues in client applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APP.CONFIG<|>CONFIGURATION<|>The App.config file is a configuration file used in .NET applications to define application settings, including runtime switches for the DGrep SDK.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACHINE CERTIFICATE STORE<|>NAMESPACE<|>The machine certificate store is a secure storage location on a machine where certificates are installed, which can be accessed by applications for authentication purposes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROWSETRESULT<|>EVENT<|>RowSetResult is an event that represents the result of a query executed against the DGrep SDK, containing information about the query's status and data.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP SDK<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>The DGrep SDK is designed to interact with the Geneva Logs service for logging and monitoring purposes.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIENT AUTHENTICATION CERTIFICATE<|>DGREP SDK<|>The client authentication certificate is required for the DGrep SDK to authenticate the client application and establish a secure connection.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUERYSTATUS<|>DGREP SDK<|>QueryStatus is a command provided by the DGrep SDK to check the status of queries executed against the Geneva Logs service.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ETW PROVIDER<|>DGREP SDK<|>The ETW provider Microsoft-Geneva-DGrep-Client logs events related to the operations of the DGrep SDK, aiding in troubleshooting and monitoring.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERFVIEW<|>ETW PROVIDER<|>PerfView can be used to collect logs from the ETW provider Microsoft-Geneva-DGrep-Client, facilitating performance analysis and troubleshooting.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APP.CONFIG<|>DGREP SDK<|>The App.config file is used to configure runtime settings for the DGrep SDK, including necessary switches for its operation.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACHINE CERTIFICATE STORE<|>CLIENT AUTHENTICATION CERTIFICATE<|>The client authentication certificate must be installed in the machine certificate store for the DGrep SDK to access it during authentication.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROWSETRESULT<|>QUERYSTATUS<|>RowSetResult contains the QueryStatus object, which provides information about the status of a query executed through the DGrep SDK.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
