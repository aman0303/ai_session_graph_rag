Geneva Logs will create resources in these subscriptions to store monitoring data collected by the Monitoring Agent (MA). Follow these steps to create subscriptions using Ev2 and to grant the Geneva Service principal access to your subscriptions.\n\n- [Creating Azure subscriptions for your service using EV2](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_wiki/wikis/One.wiki/40559/Express-V2_ARM-Deployments)\n- [Specific requirements for air gap environments](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_wiki/wikis/One.wiki/40950/Subscription-Creation-Updates-and-dSMS-whitelisting)\n- [Granting the Geneva service principal access to your subscription](../../Manageaccount/subscriptionpermissions.md)\n- [Registering resource providers with your subscription](../../Manageaccount/subscriptionpermissions.md)\n\n## Security Groups\nGeneva Logs will use security groups to control access, such as who can manage the Logs account.  Create or leverage an existing security group appropriate for the environment.  \n\n- [Creating and managing security groups](../../Manageconfig/securitygroups.md) for your service in Geneva.  \n- [Environment specific requirements and resources for Security Groups](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_wiki/wikis/One%20Fleet%20Efficiency/46649/Groups).  \n\n## Certificates\nGeneva Logs requires at least one certificate to use for authentication of the Monitoring Agent. This must be signed by a well-known Microsoft Certificate Authority, such as OneCert or DigiCert. For certain environments (e.g. air gap), these will need to be environment-specific.  \n\n- Learn more about [creating Geneva Logs certificates](~/collect/authentication/overview.md#logs) for your service. \n- Read more about [authentication to the Ev2 extension](auth.md).\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AZURE SUBSCRIPTION<|>TENANT<|>An Azure Subscription is a container that holds the details of the resources and services that are created and managed in Azure, allowing for billing and resource management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Logs is a service that collects and stores monitoring data, providing insights and management capabilities for Azure resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>The Monitoring Agent (MA) is a component that collects monitoring data from Azure resources and sends it to Geneva Logs for analysis and storage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURITY GROUPS<|>ROLE<|>Security Groups are used to manage access control for resources in Azure, determining who can manage and access the Geneva Logs account.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFICATES<|>PARAMETER<|>Certificates are required for authenticating the Monitoring Agent, ensuring secure communication and data transfer between Azure resources and Geneva Logs.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>AZURE SUBSCRIPTION<|>Geneva Logs creates resources in Azure Subscriptions to store monitoring data collected by the Monitoring Agent.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>The Monitoring Agent collects data and sends it to Geneva Logs for storage and analysis.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY GROUPS<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>Security Groups control access to the Geneva Logs account, determining who can manage it.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CERTIFICATES<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>Certificates are required for the Monitoring Agent to authenticate and securely communicate with Geneva Logs.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AZURE SUBSCRIPTION<|>SECURITY GROUPS<|>Security Groups can be created or managed within an Azure Subscription to control access to resources.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
