To get DGrep to show the scrubbed data when queried please open a ticket based on the template referenced in https://eng.ms/docs/products/geneva/support/findrightgenevateam under the DGrep Support. Make sure to list the namespace and event you wish to scrub.\n\nPlease also note the following:\n1. Once updates are done on DGrep side, DGrep will not be able to query data prior to the configuration change. In order to not lose data in DGrep you will have to make the configuration changes, wait the retention period and only then open the above mentioned ticket.\n2. There is no option to have scrubbing only in some regions for DGrep. It is a all or nothing configuration.
