In such situations, a thin client can take advantage of the distributed processing capacity and bandwidth of the DGrep backend. \n\n## How to write efficient and performant queries with DGrep SDK\n\n* Be as specific as possible regarding account monikers and event versions to search in order to minimize the number of storage accounts and blob containers to be scanned.\n\n* Use identity columns whenever possible to scope down the amount of data to be searched.\n\n* Be judicious when determining the query time range. Query times are typically proportional to their input time ranges.\n\n* If you use regular expressions in your MQL queries, test them locally against realistic data to ensure they perform well. In particular, avoid catastrophic backtracking.\n  > [!Tip]\n  > KQL provides a better regex library via RE2 and is highly performant when compared with an MQL query containing the same regular expression.\n\n* Always test your queries in the DGrep UI to make sure they perform adequately before running them programmatically.\n\n## A hello world DGrep query\n\n**Scenario:**\n \n Let's suppose, we want to search the “LogTrace” event in the “DGrep” namespace of the “production” environment and we want to retrieve all events logged in the last 30 minutes.\n\n**Code:**\n```C#\nvar input = new QueryInput\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    MdsEndpoint = new Uri(\"https://production.diagnostics.monitoring.core.windows.net/\"),\n    EventFilters = new List<EventFilter>\n    \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n        new EventFilter \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n NamespaceRegex = \"^DGrep$\", NameRegex = \"^LogTrace$\" \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n,\n    \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n,\n    StartTime = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddMinutes(-30),\n    EndTime = DateTimeOffset.Now\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n;\n\n// Using certificate based authentication\nusing (var client = new DGrepClient(DGrepEndpoint, ClientCertificate))\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    RowSetResult result = await client.GetRowSetResultAsync(input, cancellationToken);\n    var firstMessage = result.RowSet.Rows.First()[\"Message\"];\n    var status = result.QueryStatus.Status;\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n\n// Using user based authentication\nusing (var client = new DGrepUserAuthClient(DGrepEndpoint))\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    RowSetResult result = await client.GetRowSetResultAsync(input, cancellationToken);\n    var firstMessage = result.RowSet.Rows.First()[\"Message\"];\n    var status = result.QueryStatus.Status;\n\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n```\n**Steps:**\n\n> [!Note]\n> DGrepUserAuthClient is currently not supported for .net core.\n\n1. Create an instance of the `QueryInput` class, which defines the input parameters for our scenario.\n\n1. For certificate based authentication, create an instance of the `DGrepClient` class with a given DGrep endpoint and a client certificate.\n    > [!Note]\n    > The certificate used by DGrepClient should be authorized to access the events being searched. See more on [Authentication](./sdk.md#authentication).\n\n1. For user based authentication, create an instance of the `DGrepUserAuthClient` class with a given DGrep endpoint (this will open an authentication dialog prompting for the user's credentials)\n\n1. Call the `GetRowSetResultAsync` method on the client, which runs the query and returns the results.\n\n1. The `RowSetResult.RowSet.Rows` contains the rows found by the query. The rows  are represented as a list of dictionaries mapping column names to values.\n\n1. Finally, look at result.QueryStatus.Status to verify whether the query ran without failures. See more on [QueryStatus](../../troubleshooting/dgrepsdktroubleshoot.md#server-side-troubleshooting).\n\n## A closer look at QueryInput\n\n**Scenario:**\n \n Let's take a deep dive into `QueryInput` type which represents the parameters of a query.\n\n \n**Code:**\n```C#\nvar input = new QueryInput\n\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n    MdsEndpoint = new Uri(\"https://production.diagnostics.monitoring.core.windows.net/\"),\n    EventFilters = new List<EventFilter>\n    \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n        new EventFilter\n        \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n            NamespaceRegex = \"^DGrep$\",\n            NameRegex = \"^LogTrace$\",\n            VersionRegex = \"^(Ver2v0|Ver3v0)$\"\n        \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n,\n        new EventFilter\n        \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n            NamespaceRegex = \"^Test$\",\n            NameRegex = \"^MyEvent$\",\n            MonikerRegex = \"^wusmoniker$\"\n        \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n,\n    \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n,\n    IdentityColumns = new Dictionary<string, List<string>>\n    \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n        \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n \"Tenant\", new List<string> \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n \"WUS\" \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n        \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n \"Role\", new List<string> \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n \"Worker\", \"Front\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DGREP SDK<|>SERVICE<|>DGrep SDK is a software development kit that allows programmatic querying of logs, offloading log download and processing to the DGrep backend for efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MDS DATA ACCESS CLIENT<|>SERVICE<|>MdsDataAccessClient is a client-side tool that performs log download and processing operations directly on the machine where it is invoked.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUERYINPUT<|>PARAMETER<|>QueryInput is a class that defines the input parameters for querying logs, including endpoint and event filters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREP CLIENT<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>DGrepClient is a client that uses certificate-based authentication to access and query logs from the DGrep backend.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREP USER AUTH CLIENT<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>DGrepUserAuthClient is a client that uses user-based authentication to access and query logs from the DGrep backend.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENTFILTER<|>PARAMETER<|>EventFilter is a parameter that specifies criteria for filtering events in a query, such as namespace and name regex patterns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGTRACE<|>EVENT<|>LogTrace is an event type that can be queried within the DGrep namespace, representing specific log entries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREP NAMESPACE<|>NAMESPACE<|>DGrep namespace is a logical grouping of events and logs that can be queried, specifically for the DGrep service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRODUCTION<|>TENANT<|>Production is an environment where the DGrep service is deployed and operational, often used for live data querying.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP SDK<|>MDS DATA ACCESS CLIENT<|>DGrep SDK is designed to offload log processing to the DGrep backend, while MdsDataAccessClient processes logs on the client machine.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUERYINPUT<|>DGREP CLIENT<|>QueryInput is used as a parameter for the DGrepClient to define the input for querying logs.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUERYINPUT<|>DGREP USER AUTH CLIENT<|>QueryInput is also utilized by the DGrepUserAuthClient to specify the parameters for user-based log queries.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVENTFILTER<|>QUERYINPUT<|>EventFilter is a component of QueryInput that specifies the criteria for filtering events in a log query.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGTRACE<|>DGREP NAMESPACE<|>LogTrace is an event that exists within the DGrep namespace, making it part of the events that can be queried.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP CLIENT<|>PRODUCTION<|>DGrepClient is used to query logs in the production environment, accessing live data.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP USER AUTH CLIENT<|>PRODUCTION<|>DGrepUserAuthClient is also used to query logs in the production environment, allowing user-based authentication.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
