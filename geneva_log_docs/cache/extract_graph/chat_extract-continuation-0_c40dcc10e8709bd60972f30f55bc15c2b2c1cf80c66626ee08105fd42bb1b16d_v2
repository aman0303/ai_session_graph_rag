Modify `Parameters/RolloutParameters.json` in the following way:\n\n    - `extensions/connectionProperties/authentication/.../secretId` - Link to the secret in your Key Vault that contains the certificate you will use to authenticate with. This should be linked to the AAD application you are using, which you will grant permissions on your Geneva Logs and Metrics accounts.\n    - `extensions/connectionProperties/authentication/properties` - will contain the application ID and tenant ID of your AAD application.\n    - `extensions/payloadProperties` - this section has several parts to it:\n        - Referencing the LTM extension using the properties `ga-extension-name`, `ga-endpoint` and `extension`.\n        - Determining which operation to execute - here you will most likely want to execute `SetLogsToMetricsRuleByName` - keep this value for both `ga-operation-id` and \"operation\".\n        - Rest of the properties - these are the details of the LTM rule you are about to create/update. Parameterize that as well.\n\n4. `ScopeBindings.json` - This file is a part of the parameterization of EV2 spec files. Everything you want to have parameterized should also be included here. See [Scope bindings](https://ev2docs.azure.net/getting-started/tutorial/parameterize/scope-bindings.html)\n5. `Configuration/ServiceConfiguration.<ENV>.json` - This is how EV2 region-agnostic is implementing parameterization across environments. You'll probably want to have the information here somehow, and consume it in ScopeBindings.json. See [Configuration settings](https://ev2docs.azure.net/getting-started/tutorial/parameterize/configuration-settings.html?tabs=tabid-1)\n\n### Setup code, build and release pipelines\n\n1. Add the modified files from the previous section in your repo, parameterize and commit.\n\n    - You can use [EV2 feature called 'Repeat extension calls'](https://ev2docs.azure.net/features/service-artifacts/actions/http-extensions/repeatover.html) to deploy multiple rules using a single operation execution.\n\n2. Include the files in your official build drop.\n3. Create a release pipeline that will run these EV2 spec files.\n\nFor testing, you can use the EV2 client and test locally on the PPE environment (Geneva Logs endpoints Test/Smoke/Stage).\nSee [Download the Ev2 command files to your local client](https://ev2docs.azure.net/getting-started/tutorial/prepare.html?tabs=tabid-1%2Ctabid-3#download-the-ev2-command-files-to-your-local-client).\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- If your LTM rule does not produce any results and does not return any errors, verify that its scoping conditions do not use columns subject to [selective indexing](../dgrep/selectiveindexing/selectiveindexing.md), as such columns are not supported.\n- To help diagnose failures, you can collect activity id from an execution of your LTM rule deployment and follow [these steps to query Geneva Actions logs](../../../actions/How%20Do%20I/queryandpublishlogs.md#geneva-log-search-dgrep) to obtain and examine the logs related to it. To narrow down logs to only those emitted by LTM GA extension use `TraceMessage contains \"[LogsToMetrics Extension]\"` condition in the client query.\n  - You can use this [example Kusto query](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/genevaactions/databases/Production?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAA22OXQuCMBiF7%2F0VL7sq6KZuw0DKYpEYcwoSXYz5pgt1so0%2BoB9fEYhRlwfOc55TowMhnbood6cF%2BEDyOGUQLDnNKM9hk9IVrFkcwTZgGU0gZp8YZjMy97gRUrWl94BrhQZhb1Aqi1w1mDjRdLAAUerRtBj3lWBg8wfuvvDexAitFSVCJSyQw06XlusInVHSQnhz2Fql2yMB0RZ%2FgJNQNRbkNdkZfUbpfo5NvqgnAkN0vQYBAAA%3D), replace the placeholder at the top with the activity id you collected.\n\n## References\n\n- [Geneva Actions Bootcamp](https://eng.ms/docs/products/geneva/actions/bootcamp/bootcamppart1)\n- [Run Geneva Actions Operations via Ev2 Http Extensions](https://eng.ms/docs/products/geneva/actions/howdoi/runoperationviaev2)\n- [Using AAD app authentication with Geneva Actions](https://eng.ms/docs/products/geneva/actions/howdoi/useaad)\n- [EV2 specification for creating a new extension, including auth types](https://ev2docs.azure.net/features/service-artifacts/actions/http-extensions/custom-extensions/spec.html)\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROLLOUTPARAMETERS.JSON<|>CONFIGURATION<|>RolloutParameters.json is a configuration file that specifies parameters for the rollout process, including authentication and connection properties.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPEBINDINGS.JSON<|>CONFIGURATION<|>ScopeBindings.json is a configuration file used for parameterization in EV2 spec files, allowing for dynamic values during deployment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICECONFIGURATION.<ENV>.JSON<|>CONFIGURATION<|>ServiceConfiguration.<ENV>.json is a configuration file that implements parameterization across different environments in EV2.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SETLOGSTOMETRICSRULEBYNAME<|...|>COMMAND<|>SetLogsToMetricsRuleByName is a command used to execute a specific operation related to logging metrics in the Geneva Logs system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LTM EXTENSION<|...|>SERVICE<|>The LTM extension is a service that facilitates the integration of logging and metrics functionalities within the Geneva Logs framework.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Logs is a service that provides logging capabilities and is integrated with various extensions for enhanced functionality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EV2<|...|>SERVICE<|>Ev2 is a deployment framework that supports zero-touch deployment and management of services, including Geneva Logs and its extensions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AAD APPLICATION<|...|>ROLE<|>The AAD application is a role that represents an application registered in Azure Active Directory, which is used for authentication and authorization in the Geneva Logs system.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROLLOUTPARAMETERS.JSON<|>SCOPEBINDINGS.JSON<|>RolloutParameters.json includes references to ScopeBindings.json for parameterization during the rollout process.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROLLOUTPARAMETERS.JSON<|>SETLOGSTOMETRICSRULEBYNAME<|>The RolloutParameters.json file specifies the operation to execute, which includes the SetLogsToMetricsRuleByName command.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOPEBINDINGS.JSON<|>SERVICECONFIGURATION.<ENV>.JSON<|>ScopeBindings.json is utilized within ServiceConfiguration.<ENV>.json to manage parameterization across environments.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SETLOGSTOMETRICSRULEBYNAME<|>LTM EXTENSION<|>The SetLogsToMetricsRuleByName command is executed within the context of the LTM extension to manage logging metrics.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LTM EXTENSION<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>The LTM extension is integrated with Geneva Logs to enhance its logging and metrics capabilities.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>EV2<|>Geneva Logs is managed and deployed using the Ev2 framework for streamlined operations.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AAD APPLICATION<|>ROLLOUTPARAMETERS.JSON<|>The RolloutParameters.json file includes authentication details related to the AAD application for secure access.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
