Inside a string literal, a double quote is written (escaped) as two consecutive double quotes. All public methods and properties exposed by System.String except the overrides using enums such as StringComparison are supported. In addition, the following extension methods are usable as well:\n\n|Method|Description|\n|------|-----------|\n|ContainsI(string value)| Case insensitive version of string.Contains method.|\n|EqualsI(string value)| A shorthand for string.Equals method with StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase.\n|StartsWithI(string value)| A shorthand for string.StartsWith method with StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase.\n|EndsWithI(string value)| A shorthand for string.EndsWith method with StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase.\n|IndexOfI(string value)| A shorthand for string.IndexOf method with StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase.\n|LastIndexOfI(string value)| A shorthand for string.LastIndexOf method with StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase.\n|Matches(string regex)| A shorthand for Regex.Matches method.\n|MatchesI(string regex)| A shorthand for Regex.Matches method called with RegexOptions.IgnoreCase.\n|IsMatch(string regex)| A shorthand for Regex.IsMatch method.\n|IsMatchI(string regex)| A shorthand for Regex.IsMatch method called with RegexOptions.IgnoreCase.\n|~= (tilda equals)| A shorthand for IsMatchI method above.\n\n### String Splitting\nIn addition to Regex operations, you can use the `Split` method of the string to extract information from a column. This returns a `string[]`, so you can also calculate the number of parts by using the `Length` property.\n\nThe following example parses a log line like the following (same examples as the one in the Regex section, with a different implementation):\n\n```\nProbe succeeded|[1]AlertingLatency::236|[2]ClientLatency::408|...[13]MachineInfo::USR3372285-037|...[21]RunnerInstance::Edog/US/EDOG_CONTENT/Primary|[22]RunnerInstanceNum::1|...\n```\n\nExpression below extracts whether the probe succeeded or not, the alerting latency, the machine information and the farm name. It then calculates the average availability and 99th percentile of the alerting latency.\n\n```javascript\nlet f = UserField2.Split('|')\nlet fieldCount = f.Length\nlet success = Status == \"Healthy\" ? 1 : 0\nlet MachineName = f[13].Substring(f[13].IndexOf(\"::\") + 2 )\nlet Farm = f[21].Substring(f[21].IndexOf(\"::\") + 2 )\nlet Latency = Int32.Parse(f[1].Substring(f[1].IndexOf(\"::\") + 2 ))\ngroupby MachineName, Farm \n    let Availability = 100 * Average(success), \n        Percentile = Percentile(Latency, 99)\n```\n\n## Working with Date/Time\nAll public methods and properties of System.DateTime except the overrides using enums such as DateTimeKind are supported.\n\nDate/time literals may be specified either as string literals, which are parsed automatically, or using the DateTime() constructor. All date/time literals are interpreted as UTC. All of the following expressions are equivalent:\n\n```javascript\ntimestamp == \"2009-07-14T12:20:37\"\ntimestamp == \"2009-07-14T12:20:37Z\"\ntimestamp == \"2009/7/14 12:20:37\"\ntimestamp == \"2009/7/14 12:20:37Z\"\ntimestamp == DateTime(2009, 7, 14, 12, 20, 37)\ntimestamp == DateTime.Parse(\"2009/7/14 12:20:37\")\ntimestamp == DateTime.Parse(\"2009/7/14 12:20:37Z\")\n```\n\n### DateTime RoundDown\n```javascript\npublic static DateTime RoundDown(this DateTime input, string interval)\npublic static DateTime RoundDown(this DateTime input, string interval, string offset)\n```\n\n​These two methods round down the input time according to the given interval expressed as a time period specification. The second overload, in addition, accepts an offset expressed as a time period specification that allows shifting the interval as needed.\n\nValid time period specification syntax is \"P[dD][T[hH][mM][sS]]\" where d is number of days, h is number of hours, m is number of minutes, s is number of seconds and the other characters are literals. At least one time part must be present.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```javascript\ntimestamp.RoundDown(\"PT1M\") returns 2009/7/14 12:20:00\ntimestamp.RoundDown(\"PT30M\") returns 2009/7/14 12:00:00\ntimestamp.RoundDown(\"PT30M\", \"PT5M\") returns 2009/7/14 12:05:00\n```\n\n### DateTime RoundUp\n```javascript\npublic static DateTime RoundUp(this DateTime input, string interval)\n​public static DateTime RoundUp(this DateTime input, string interval, string offset)\n```\n\n​These two methods round up the input time according to the given interval expressed as a time interval specification. The second overload, in addition, accepts an offset expressed as a time period specification that allows shifting the interval as needed.\n\nValid time period specification syntax is \"P[dD][T[hH][mM][sS]]\" where d is number of days, h is number of hours, m is number of minutes, s is number of seconds and the other characters are literals. At least one time part must be present.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```javascript\ntimestamp.RoundUp(\"PT1M\") returns 2009/7/14 12:21:00\ntimestamp.RoundUp(\"PT30M\") returns 2009/7/14 12:30:00\ntimestamp\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STRING LITERAL<|>PARAMETER<|>A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, used to represent text in programming languages.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>NAMESPACE<|>System.String is a class in .NET that represents a sequence of characters and provides methods for string manipulation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTAINSI<|>COMMAND<|>ContainsI is an extension method that performs a case-insensitive check to see if a string contains a specified substring.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQUALSI<|>COMMAND<|>EqualsI is a shorthand extension method for comparing two strings for equality in a case-insensitive manner.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARTSWITHI<|>COMMAND<|>StartsWithI is an extension method that checks if a string starts with a specified substring, ignoring case.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENDSWITHI<|>COMMAND<|>EndsWithI is an extension method that checks if a string ends with a specified substring, ignoring case.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDEXOFI<|>COMMAND<|>IndexOfI is an extension method that returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence of a specified substring in a string, ignoring case.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LASTINDEXOFI<|>COMMAND<|>LastIndexOfI is an extension method that returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence of a specified substring in a string, ignoring case.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATCHES<|>COMMAND<|>Matches is an extension method that performs a regex match on a string.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATCHESI<|>COMMAND<|>MatchesI is an extension method that performs a case-insensitive regex match on a string.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISMATCH<|>COMMAND<|>IsMatch is an extension method that checks if a string matches a specified regex pattern.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISMATCHI<|>COMMAND<|>IsMatchI is an extension method that checks if a string matches a specified regex pattern in a case-insensitive manner.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPLIT<|>COMMAND<|>Split is a method that divides a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRING[]<|>PARAMETER<|>A string array is a collection of strings that can be used to store multiple string values.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATETIME<|>NAMESPACE<|>System.DateTime is a structure in .NET that represents date and time values.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROUNDOWN<|>COMMAND<|>RoundDown is a method that rounds down a DateTime value to the nearest specified interval.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROUNDUP<|>COMMAND<|>RoundUp is a method that rounds up a DateTime value to the nearest specified interval.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STRING LITERAL<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>String literals are represented as instances of the System.String class in .NET.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTAINSI<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>ContainsI is a method that operates on instances of System.String to check for substring presence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EQUALSI<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>EqualsI is a method that compares two System.String instances for equality.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STARTSWITHI<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>StartsWithI is a method that checks if a System.String starts with a specified substring.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENDSWITHI<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>EndsWithI is a method that checks if a System.String ends with a specified substring.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDEXOFI<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>IndexOfI is a method that finds the index of a substring within a System.String.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LASTINDEXOFI<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>LastIndexOfI is a method that finds the last index of a substring within a System.String.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATCHES<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>Matches is a method that performs regex operations on a System.String.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATCHESI<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>MatchesI is a method that performs case-insensitive regex operations on a System.String.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISMATCH<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>IsMatch is a method that checks if a System.String matches a regex pattern.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISMATCHI<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>IsMatchI is a method that checks if a System.String matches a regex pattern in a case-insensitive manner.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPLIT<|>SYSTEM.STRING<|>Split is a method that operates on System.String to divide it into substrings.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROUNDOWN<|>DATETIME<|>RoundDown is a method that operates on DateTime values to round them down to specified intervals.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROUNDUP<|>DATETIME<|>RoundUp is a method that operates on DateTime values to round them up to specified intervals.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
