VRS is not actually a different replication type; it is merely a way of specifying the use of existing (ZRS/GRS/LRS) replication types at the storage metadata level. If a region does not support the desired replication type, storage accounts created as VRS would temporarily belong to a fallback replication type and would later be automatically migrated to the desired type when the region starts including the support.\n\nGSM is going to start provisioning all storage accounts as VRS over the coming months starting with Poland Central and the EUAP regions first, and then worldwide afterwards. Go-live is expected to be in October '22 for the rest of the world. \n\nToday when we create a storage account, we have to specify the resiliency type of the storage account we want i.e. ZRS, GRS, LRS etc. If the preferred replication type is not supported in the region, GSM will create a storage account from a backup replication type belonging to the order (ZRS > GRS > LRS). And the expectation is that when the region starts supporting the replication type, GSM will migrate the storage account to the preferred type. \nInstead, the storage team has come up with a better way to do this. While creating a storage account type we can set some Variable Resiliency properties (hence, VRS) where we provide a Maximum and Minimum replication type. If the region does not support that type, it will temporarily create a replication type based on the minimum replication type specified during provisioning. But when the region does eventually support the desired replication type, they will migrate the storage account in place on their end. Hence, customers do not have to worry about regional support at all and avoid the need to migrate monikers.. \n\n<!-- Reference links -->\n[MigrateToGCS]: ./gcs.md \"Migrate to GCS\"\n[RBAC settings]: ../references/subscriptionpermissions.md \"How to setup an Azure subscription for GSM?\"\n[MA startup parameters]: ../../../collect/references/start.md \"MA startup parameters\"\n\n<!-- Images -->\n[GSM-enabled configuration]: ../images/GsmEnabledConfig.bmp \"GSM-enabled configuration\"\n[GSMStorageGroup]: ../images/GsmStorageGroup.png \"New Storage Group in GSM\"\n[GSMTags]: ../images/GsmTags.png \"Tags on GSM resources\"\n\n### 16. Geneva Logs: I have GSM resources (storage accounts or event hub namespaces) whose keys aren't getting rotated. Why not?\n\nGSM will rotate account keys for any resources that it is tracking as a registered resource. In some cases, customers may have deleted the monikers that refer to the resources, but not delete the actual underlying resources. In this case, the Geneva Logs control plane is no longer aware of these resources, and will not rotate the keys.\n\n> [!Note]\n> Geneva does not have delete permissions on managed resources in customer subscriptions; it is incapable of deleting any resources itself.\n\nIf you would like to determine if resources are still registered with Geneva, examine [this Kusto query](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/genevawarmpath.westus2/databases/GenevaWarmPathSnapShots?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAAz2NSwrCQAyG954i9BxWcCVC68K66DYOP%2B1Qm0iSIoKHr0PR%2FfdoVfIE60KNBxxT0kXCdx96jTBQJ%2Fz0UaPhOx5U13RCtOpxRYLEWRwWWeWWZ%2FydvsR%2BqQvPoKQSnMWp2n8tGL11MfLtSbyRJAUthUO1Ahf%2FpkCWAAAA) and enter the storage account names in the placeholder values. If no rows are returned, then Geneva will not rotate the keys for those resources (and they may be candidates for deletion). Please note that if the resources still contain data in immutable containers, the accounts will not be deletable until the immutable policy on those containers have expired.\n\n### 17. Geneva Logs: I can't delete the storage account due to an immutable policy, even though the account is empty.\n\nDeletion of a storage account can generally be done using Azure portal/Geneva actions. However, if any of the events associated with a storage account was marked as immutable, the deletion of the storage accounts gets blocked due to the immutability locks on the containers. This is because a storage account with immutable containers can be deleted only when they meet the following conditions:\n \n1.\tAll the containers with immutability are empty.\n\nIf you are sure that this condition is met, jump to condition 2.\n\nIf there is immutable data in a container, then the container/storage account cannot be deleted until the data has expired. To check the Expiry Date of the Immutable Blob containers, you can follow: [Configure immutability policies for containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/immutable-policy-configure-container-scope?tabs=azure-portal).\n\nIf the storage account is still connected to a Geneva moniker, then Geneva would be regularly cleaning the expired blobs and you need to wait for all the blobs to expire. However, if the moniker reference has been deleted from Geneva, then the cleanup would have stopped, and the containers need to be cleaned up manually by setting a lifecycle management policy. You need to follow this documentation by Azure on the required steps: [Configure a lifecycle management policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-policy-configure?tabs=azure-portal).\n \n2.\tAll\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VRS<|>PARAMETER<|>Variable Resiliency Storage (VRS) is a method for specifying the use of existing replication types (ZRS/GRS/LRS) at the storage metadata level, allowing for automatic migration to preferred types when supported by the region.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE ACCOUNTS<|>SERVICE<|>Storage accounts are cloud storage resources that allow users to store and manage data in Azure, with various replication types available for resiliency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GSM<|>ROLE<|>GSM is responsible for provisioning storage accounts and managing their replication types, ensuring that accounts are created with the appropriate resiliency settings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLAND CENTRAL<|>TENANT<|>Poland Central is one of the initial regions where GSM will start provisioning storage accounts as VRS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUAP REGIONS<|>TENANT<|>EUAP regions are among the first areas where GSM will implement VRS provisioning for storage accounts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPLICATION TYPES<|>PARAMETER<|>Replication types such as ZRS, GRS, and LRS define how data is replicated across Azure's infrastructure for durability and availability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM REPLICATION TYPE<|>PARAMETER<|>Maximum and Minimum replication types are properties set during the creation of a storage account to define the acceptable replication levels.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Logs is a service that tracks resources and manages key rotations for registered resources in Azure.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUSTO QUERY<|>QUERY<|>A Kusto query is a query language used to retrieve and analyze data from Azure services, including checking the registration status of resources with Geneva.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMMUTABLE POLICY<|>PARAMETER<|>An immutable policy is a setting that prevents deletion of data in Azure storage accounts until certain conditions are met, ensuring data retention.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>STORAGE ACCOUNTS<|>GSM provisions storage accounts and manages their replication types, ensuring they are created with the appropriate settings.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VRS<|>REPLICATION TYPES<|>VRS specifies the use of existing replication types at the storage metadata level, allowing for flexible storage account configurations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLAND CENTRAL<|>GSM<|>GSM will begin provisioning storage accounts as VRS starting in the Poland Central region.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUAP REGIONS<|>GSM<|>GSM will also start provisioning storage accounts as VRS in the EUAP regions, indicating a phased rollout.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM REPLICATION TYPE<|>STORAGE ACCOUNTS<|>When creating a storage account, users can set maximum and minimum replication types to define acceptable resiliency levels.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>STORAGE ACCOUNTS<|>Geneva Logs tracks storage accounts and manages key rotations for those that are registered as resources.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUSTO QUERY<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>A Kusto query can be used to check if resources are still registered with Geneva, impacting key rotation processes.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMMUTABLE POLICY<|>STORAGE ACCOUNTS<|>An immutable policy can prevent the deletion of storage accounts, affecting their management and lifecycle.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
