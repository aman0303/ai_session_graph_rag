Each returned object is a group and consists of all the properties in the key plus a special property, called 'grouping', containing the list of all the group members.\n\n### Usage\n```javascript\ngroupby [expresion1] as [identifier], [expression2] as [identifier], ...\n\ngroup [expression 1] as [identifier], [expression 2] as [identifier], ... by [expression 3] as [identifier], [expression 3] as [identifier], ...\n```\n\n__as [identifier]__ is optional\n\nThe difference between 'groupby ...' and 'group ... by ...' is what properties are available\nfor subsequent aggregation functions:\nAfter the former, aggregation functions can refer to any property in the input sequence objects,\nwhereas after the latter, aggregation functions can only refer to the properties explicitly listed between 'group' and 'by'.\n\n### Examples\nThe following example shows the count of rows grouped by role instances:\n\n```javascript\ngroupby RoleInstance let count = count()\n```\n\nThe following example shows the average latency grouped by role instance:\n```javascript\ngroupby RoleInstance let averageLatency = average(Latency)\n```\nSee \"Expression Syntax\" page for more information on the supported aggegates.\n\nThe following example groups the counter values by Tenant, Role, RoleInstance and CounterName (these four properties are the key and uniquely identify a group). \nAt the same time, this example specifies that each group member object should have just two properties, TIMESTAMP and CounterValue:\n\n```javascript\ngroup timestamp, countervalue by tenant, role, roleinstance, countername\n```\n\nThe following example is very similar to the one above except that the properties of a group member are not specified. By default, the properties of a group member will be the same as the properties of an object in the input sequence:\n\n```javascript\ngroupby tenant, role, roleinstance, countername\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> If you want to use this clause in server side queries, please read [Server Side Query -> Distributed Nature](../../concepts/serverquery.md#distributed-nature) first.\n\n## Aggregation\nAn aggregate function is a function that can be called on a collection or sequence of elements. The most common way to retrieve a sequence is by using the “group” clause, in which case each element of the sequence is a group member.\n\n### int Count()\nReturns the number of elements in a sequence.\n\nExample: count the members of a group\n\n```javascript\ngroupby Tenant let count = Count()\n```\n\n### int Sum(expression)\nComputes the sum of a sequence of numeric values. Argument expression is a numeric expression that is evaluated on each element of the sequence.\n\nExample: Sum the count of all operations for each tenant and operation type (TotalCount is a property of each group member):\n\n```javascript\ngroupby Tenant, Operation let TenantOperationCount = sum(TotalCount)\n```\n\n### double Average(expression)\n\nComputes the average of a sequence of numeric values. Argument expression is a numeric expression that is evaluated on each element of the sequence.\n\nExample: Calculate average operation duration for each tenant name and operation type (TotalDuration is a property of each group member):\n\n```javascript\ngroupby tenant, operation let avgDuration = Average(TotalDuration)\n```\n\n### TResult Percentile(expression, percent)\n\nComputes the percentile value of a supplied sequence of numeric values for a given percentage. Parameter percent is a value between 0 and 100. This method uses the same method as Excel's PERCENTILE.INC function.\n\nExample: Calculate the 99th percentile of latency grouped by operation:\n\n```javascript\ngroupby operation let latency99 = Percentile(Latency, 99)\n```\n\n### TResult Min(expression)\nReturns the minimum value in a sequence of values. Argument expression is an expression that returns a value of a comparable type. This expression is evaluated on each element of the sequence.\n\nExample: Calculate minimum operation time stamp for each tenant name and operation type (TIMESTAMP is a property of each group member):\n\n```javascript\ngroupby tenant, operation let minTime = Min(TIMESTAMP)\n```\n\n### TResult Max(expression)\nReturns the maximum value in a sequence of values. Argument expression is an expression that returns a value of a comparable type. This expression is evaluated on each element of the sequence.\n\nExample: Calculate maximum operation time stamp for each tenant name and operation type (TIMESTAMP is a property of each group member):\n\n```javascript\ngroupby tenant, operation let minTime = Max(TIMESTAMP)\n```\n\n### TSequenceElement First()\nReturns the first element of a sequence. \n\nExample: Return the first operation result for each tenant and operation type (Result is a property of each group member):\n\n```javascript\ngroupby tenant, operation let firstResult=First().Result\n```\n\n### TSequenceElement Last()\nReturns the last element of a sequence.\n\nExample: Return the last operation result for each tenant and operation type (Result is a property of each group member):\n\n```javascript\ngroupby tenant, operation let lastResult=Last().Result\n```\n\n###double StDev(expression, isPopulationStDev)\nComputes the standard deviation of a sequence of numeric values. Argument expression is a numeric expression that is evaluated on each element of the sequence. Parameter isPopulationStDev is a boolean argument: if set to false, sample standard deviation is calculated. If set to true, population standard deviation is calculated.\n\nExample: Calculate the sample standard deviation of latency grouped by operation.\n\n```javascript\ngroupby operation let dev = StDev(latency, false)\n```\n\n### double Variance(expression, isPopulationVariance)\nComputes the variance of a sequence of numeric values. Argument expression is a numeric expression that is evaluated on each element of the sequence. Parameter isPopulationVariance is a boolean argument\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GROUPBY<|>COMMAND<|>The groupby command is used to group a sequence of objects based on specified properties, allowing for aggregation functions to be applied to the grouped data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUP<|>COMMAND<|>The group command is used to group elements of a sequence by specified properties, enabling aggregation functions to operate on the grouped data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE INSTANCE<|>PARAMETER<|>Role Instance is a property used to identify instances of roles in a sequence, often utilized in aggregation functions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENANT<|>PARAMETER<|>Tenant is a property that represents a unique identifier for a customer or organization in a multi-tenant environment, used in grouping and aggregation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTER NAME<|>PARAMETER<|>Counter Name is a property that identifies specific metrics or counters being tracked in the data, used for grouping purposes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIMESTAMP<|>PARAMETER<|>Timestamp is a property that records the time at which an event occurred, often used in aggregation functions to analyze time-based data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTER VALUE<|>PARAMETER<|>Counter Value is a property that represents the value of a specific metric or counter at a given time, used in aggregation calculations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGGREGATE FUNCTION<|>EVENT<|>An aggregate function is a mathematical function that operates on a collection of values to return a single value, commonly used in data analysis.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROUPBY<|>ROLE INSTANCE<|>The groupby command can utilize Role Instance as a property to group data for aggregation functions.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROUPBY<|>TENANT<|>The groupby command can utilize Tenant as a property to group data for aggregation functions.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROUP<|>COUNTER NAME<|>The group command can utilize Counter Name as a property to group data for aggregation functions.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROUP<|>TIMESTAMP<|>The group command can utilize Timestamp as a property to group data for aggregation functions.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGGREGATE FUNCTION<|>COUNTER VALUE<|>Aggregate functions often operate on Counter Value to compute metrics like sum, average, etc.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
