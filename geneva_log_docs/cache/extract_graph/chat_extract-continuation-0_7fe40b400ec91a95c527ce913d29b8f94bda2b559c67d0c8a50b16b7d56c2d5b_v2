01/22/2025\n---\n\n# Extensibility SDK API reference\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This information applies to the .NET Standard Extensibility SDK `Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk`.\n> For more information, see [Extensibility SDK Overview](./intro.md).\n\nThe Extensibility SDK library consists of two NuGet packages:\n\n- [Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_artifacts/feed/Official/NuGet/Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk):\n  Use this package to receive Geneva Log event messages.\n\n- [Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk.Blob.IO](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_artifacts/feed/Official/NuGet/Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk.Blob.IO):\n  Use this package to receive Geneva Log event messages and deserialize the data into a list of records.\n\n# Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk reference\n\nStart here: [Using the Extensibility SDK](./usage.md).\nThis reference describes the rest of the API in more detail.\n\n## EventStreamProcessor\n\n`EventStreamProcessor` processes Log events from Event Hubs.\n\n### EventStreamProcessor.ClearEventHubsCheckpointsAsync\n\nThis method clears Event Hubs checkpoints in case you need to reset processor offsets.\n\n- The SDK automatically manages checkpoint storage for you.\n  The checkpoint blobs are stored in Geneva Log moniker storage accounts.\n  All you have to do is specify the normal `EventStreamProcessor` parameters as usual: `genevaAccountDetails`, `eventFilters`, and `eventHubDetails`.\n- Checkpoints are partitioned and cleared based on the consumer group (`EventHubDetails.ConsumerGroup`), broker kind (`EventHubDetails.BrokerKind`), Logs account (`GenevaAccountDetails.MdsAccounts`), and event filter.\n  If you clear checkpoints for your consumer group, it will not affect checkpoints for other consumer groups.\n  Likewise, if you clear checkpoints for one Logs account, it will not affect checkpoints for other Logs accounts.\n  If you have multiple processors with different parameters like different Logs accounts or different event filters, be sure to clear checkpoints for all your processors and parameters.\n- Be sure to stop all processors while clearing checkpoints or unexpected errors may occur.\n  If processors are running, the Event Hubs client library should detect errors in the Event Hubs infrastructure and execute a load balancing cycle to recover.\n  The SDK logs may include the following error:\n  ```\n  Azure.RequestFailedException: Attempting to renew all of the processor's partition ownership in the storage service.. For troubleshooting information, see https://aka.ms/azsdk/net/eventhubs/exceptions/troubleshoot.\n  \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\"FormattedMessage\":\"Error in the Event Hubs infrastructure. Operation: Executing a load balancing cycle..\"\n  ```\n- When processors restart without checkpoints, they will begin processing from scratch.\n  For more information on how processors startup without checkpoints, see [EventHubDetails](./usage.md#eventhubdetails).\n- Sample: This example shows how to clear all of the Event Hubs checkpoints used by a processor.\n  ```cs\n  using var processor = new EventStreamProcessor(\n      genevaAccountDetails,\n      eventFilters,\n      eventHubDetails,\n      eventStreamBase,\n      telemetryDetails);\n  foreach (var mdsAccount in genevaAccountDetails.MdsAccounts)\n  \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n      foreach  (var eventFilter in eventFilters)\n      \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n          await processor.ClearEventHubsCheckpointsAsync(mdsAccount, eventFilter, cancellationToken: cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);\n      \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n  \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n  ```\n- Sample: This example shows how to clear all of the Event Hub checkpoints in a consumer group, broker kind, and Logs account by specifying a wildcard event filter `\".*\"`.\n  This may take longer if a Logs account has many monikers.\n  ```cs\n  var wildcardEventFilter = EventFilterDetails.CreateFilter(namespaceRegex: \".*\");\n  foreach (var mdsAccount in genevaAccountDetails.MdsAccounts)\n  \n -- openCurlyBracket -- \n\n      await processor.ClearEventHubsCheckpointsAsync(mdsAccount, wildcardEventFilter, cancellationToken: cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);\n  \n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n\n  ```\n- `preserveCheckpointMigrationCompletion` sample: This example shows how to clear Event Hub checkpoints without re-migrating checkpoints.\n  ```cs\n  await processor.ClearEventHubsCheckpointsAsync(mdsAccount, eventFilter, preserveCheckpointMigrationCompletion: true, cancellationToken: cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);\n  ```\n  By default, this method clears Event Hubs checkpoints including any migrated checkpoints and the checkpoint migration completion status.\n  If `preserveCheckpointMigrationCompletion` is set, the checkpoint migration completion status is not cleared, and checkpoints will not be re-migrated.\n  This is an unusual case intended to control how checkpoints are cleared while migration is in progress.\n  It is strongly recommended to remove the `MigrationDetails` instead when migration is complete.\n  Then there is no need to set `preserveCheckpointMigrationCompletion`.\n\n## BlobEventData\n\nThis class provides information about every blob you may process.\nMost details are intended for use by the Kusto team.\nThe properties exposed by the `BlobEventData` object are:\n\n```cs\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EXTENSIBILITY SDK<|>SERVICE<|>The Extensibility
