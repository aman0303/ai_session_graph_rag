For GSM enabled accounts, start your monitoring agent with the new region in the GCS parameters.\n\n````\nset MONITORING_GCS_REGION=<new region ARM name>\n````\n\n![GSM scale out](./images/GsmScaleOut.png)\n\n* For GSM enabled accounts, provisioning of storage accounts and event hubs in the new region will be handled by Geneva Infrastructure when the Monitoring agent from the newly deployed region is trying to get the SAS tokens for the new region.\n* There will be an initial delay of up to 3-5 mins to provision the necessary storage accounts and event hubs for the new regions and picked up by Monitoring agent.\n* The Monitoring Agent will retry with an exponential back off until the new resources are provisioned and SAS tokens for them are obtained.\n* Once the resources are provisioned and SAS key obtained, monitoring agent will start to push data to the new resources.\nWhile the monitoring data will start getting recorded in the newly provisioned storage account in about 3-5 minutes, it may take up to 15 minutes or more for the data to be queriable in DGrep.\n\n## How does GSM detect that I need more resources within a region?\n\nGSM creates one storage shard (storage account + Event Hub account) when it scales out to a new region. If this storage shard is not enough to handle the volume of monitoring data generated in that region, a new storage shard may be required to avoid data loss. This section explains how GSM determines if an expansion is required in a region based on metrics collected for the storage account.\n\nGSM gathers following storage metrics for each storage account:\n\n* **TotalRequests** : The requests made to a storage service. This includes success and failed requests.\n* **BlobThrottlingErrorPercentage**: The percentage of requests getting throttled by blob service.\n* **BlobThrottlingError**: The requests getting throttled by the blob service.\n* **TotalThrottlingError**: The requests getting throttled by the (blob + table + queue + file) service.\n* **StorageAvailability**: The availability of the storage service (in percentage). Availability is calculated by taking the TotalBillableRequests and dividing it by the number of applicable requests, including those that produced unexpected errors.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n> All unexpected errors result in reduced availability of the storage service.\n\nUsing these metrics GSM creates the [Storage health dashboard](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/dashboard/GSMHealthMonitoring/HealthMetrics-Resource/HealthMetrics). You can use this dashboard to view the health of the storage accounts. (Replace the Logs account name in the dashboard with your account name).\n\nThe following logic is used by GSM to monitor the health of the storage accounts.\n\n* GSM gathers the **BlobThrottlingErrorPercentage** for last 24 hours.\n* GSM divides the timeseries into 8 buckets of 3 hours. It checks whether there was an increasing trend in throttling percentage in each of the buckets.\n* GSM checks whether there was a continuous throttling of more than 5% for the entire 24 hours.\n\n![Storage throttling](./images/StorageThrottling.png)\n\nIf GSM deems the storage accounts unhealthy, it will automatically expand in that region by provisioning a new storage shard.\n\nIn addition to Storage Accounts, GSM also monitors metrics on the Event Hub in the Storage Shard:\n\n* **EHINMSGS** : Total incoming messages for a namespace\n* **IncomingMessages** : Incoming Messages for Microsoft.EventHub\n* **OutgoingMessages** : Outgoing Messages for Microsoft.EventHub\n* **ThrottledRequests** : Throttled Requests for Microsoft.EventHub\n* **SVRBSY** : Total server busy errors for a namespace\n* **EventReceived_IdleTimeMillis**  - Eventhub Event Received per minute\n\nUsing these metrics, GSM creates the [Event Hub health dashboard](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/s/B805C0D8?globalStartTime=1661374365057&globalEndTime=1661385165057&pinGlobalTimeRange=true).  You can use this dashboard to view the health of specific Event Hubs. (Replace the Logs account name in the dashboard with your account name).\n\nGSM uses the following thresholds to monitor the health of the event hubs:\n\nIn the last 24 hours, if any of these metrics exceed the given threshold, an additional storage shard (Storage account + Event Hub pair) will be allocated for the affected storage group in the same region.  A maximum of one expansion per storage group per region per 24 hours will be performed.\n\nEHINMSGS / IncomingMessages / OutgoingMessages : 3.6M events per minute\nThrottledRequests / SVRBSY : 5 instances per minute\nEventReceived_IdleTimeMillis : 80,000 ms per minute\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GSM<|>SERVICE<|>GSM is a service that manages the scaling and provisioning of resources in Azure regions for monitoring and data handling purposes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>The Monitoring Agent is a component that collects data and interacts with Azure resources, particularly during the scaling process in new regions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCS PARAMETERS<|>PARAMETER<|>GCS parameters are configuration settings used by the Monitoring Agent to define the region and other settings for resource provisioning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING DATA<|>EVENT<|>Monitoring data refers to the information collected by the Monitoring Agent regarding the performance and health of Azure resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE ACCOUNTS<|>SERVICE<|>Storage Accounts are Azure resources used to store data, which are provisioned by GSM when scaling out to new regions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT HUBS<|>SERVICE<|>Event Hubs are Azure services that handle large-scale event streaming and are monitored by GSM for health and performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE HEALTH DASHBOARD<|>SERVICE<|>The Storage Health Dashboard is a monitoring tool created by GSM to visualize the health metrics of storage accounts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT HUB HEALTH DASHBOARD<|>SERVICE<|>The Event Hub Health Dashboard is a monitoring tool created by GSM to visualize the health metrics of Event Hubs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOB THROTTLING ERROR PERCENTAGE<|>PARAMETER<|>Blob Throttling Error Percentage is a metric that indicates the percentage of requests to the blob service that are being throttled.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THROTTLED REQUESTS<|>PARAMETER<|>Throttled Requests refer to the number of requests that are limited or blocked by Azure services due to resource constraints.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE SHARD<|>SERVICE<|>A Storage Shard is a combination of a storage account and an Event Hub that is provisioned by GSM to handle monitoring data in a specific region.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>GSM manages the Monitoring Agent, which is responsible for collecting data and provisioning resources in new regions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>GCS PARAMETERS<|>The Monitoring Agent uses GCS parameters to configure its operation in the new region during scaling.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MONITORING DATA<|>The Monitoring Agent collects monitoring data to assess the performance and health of Azure resources.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>STORAGE ACCOUNTS<|>GSM provisions storage accounts when scaling out to new regions to handle monitoring data.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>EVENT HUBS<|>GSM provisions Event Hubs alongside storage accounts to manage event streaming in new regions.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>STORAGE HEALTH DASHBOARD<|>GSM creates the Storage Health Dashboard to visualize the health metrics of the storage accounts it manages.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>EVENT HUB HEALTH DASHBOARD<|>GSM creates the Event Hub Health Dashboard to visualize the health metrics of the Event Hubs it manages.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STORAGE ACCOUNTS<|>STORAGE SHARD<|>Storage accounts are part of a storage shard, which is provisioned by GSM to handle monitoring data in a specific region.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVENT HUBS<|>STORAGE SHARD<|>Event Hubs are part of a storage shard, which is provisioned by GSM to manage event streaming in a specific region.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOB THROTTLING ERROR PERCENTAGE<|>THROTTLED REQUESTS<|>Blob Throttling Error Percentage is a specific metric that contributes to the overall count of Throttled Requests in Azure services.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
