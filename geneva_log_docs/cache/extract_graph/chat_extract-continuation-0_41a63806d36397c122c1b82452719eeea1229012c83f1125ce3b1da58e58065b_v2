If you absolutely cannot SNAT, you must begin migration to IPv6, as Geneva will eventually require it for non-SNAT scenarios.

You can use this in your Network Security Groups to enable outbound traffic to Geneva.\n\nYou also need to allow the service tags for Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you need to ACL IP addresses directly in your firewall, you *must* keep your them up to date with the latest IPs in the `AzureMonitor`, Azure Storage, and Azure Event Hubs tags, as we are continually expanding and adding IP addresses. Downloadable IP ranges and a discovery API are documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview).\n\nQuestions about service tags? Email Azure Networking at `AzServiceTagOnboard` alias or visit [their sharepoint site](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/vnet/SitePages/Service%20Tags.aspx).\n\n*Is your service in Blackforest or Mooncake, or using GIG in any cloud?
