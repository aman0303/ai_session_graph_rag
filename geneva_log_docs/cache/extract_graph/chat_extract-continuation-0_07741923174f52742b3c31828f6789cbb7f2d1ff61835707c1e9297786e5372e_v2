The regex rule to define whether this line of code is using\nstring interpolation is as follows:\n\n```cs\n.Log(?:Critical|Debug|Error|Information|Trace|Warning)\\(.*(?:\\$|string.Format\\()\".+\".*\\)\n```\n\nRefer to this PR for possible and negative cases:\n<https://dev.azure.com/mseng/Domino/_git/2996b0dc-7ca7-421c-9a9f-dc507e3b86a4/pullrequest/793580?_a=files>\n\n#### [What is the engineering challenge that’s being addressed?](#what-is-the-engineering-challenge-thats-being-addressed)\n\nUsing string interpolation in logging code violates security best practices for\nseveral reasons.\n\nFirst, string interpolation can introduce security vulnerabilities. For example,\nif an attacker uses injection techniques, the interpolated string can result in\nunexpected behavior, potentially allowing unauthorized access or other security\nbreaches.\n\nSecond, string interpolation lacks a durable identifier (durable ID) to trace\neach line of log data, making tracking and auditing difficult. Without a durable\nID, it's challenging to trace back to the exact line of code in the source. This\nconsistency is crucial for accurately identifying and redacting sensitive\ninformation without losing the context of the log entries.\n\nThird, string interpolation does not support structured payloads, which hinders\nthe ability to use tools for effective log analysis. Structured logging formats,\nsuch as JSON, provide a more consistent and searchable log output, enabling\nbetter troubleshooting and monitoring.\n\nFinally, using string interpolation poses significant performance issues.\nThe process of creating interpolated strings can be computationally expensive,\nespecially in high-frequency logging scenarios. This can lead to unnecessary\nperformance overhead and impact the overall efficiency of the application.\nSee: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2254>.\n\n#### Why is this problem significant? How will this solution help mitigate the issue?\n\nIn summary, avoiding string interpolation in .NET logging enhances security,\nperformance, and log analysis capabilities. Instead, use compile-time source\ngeneration that supports structured logging and durable identifiers.\n\n##### What is Durable ID?\n\nDurable IDs are unique identifiers that remain consistent across different log\nentries and sessions. They act like a GPS for debugging and analysis, allowing\nyou to trace logs back to the exact line of code in the source. This consistency\nis crucial for accurately identifying and redacting sensitive information\nwithout losing the context of the log entries.\n\n##### What is the Structured Payload?\n\nStructured payloads refer to the organization of log data into a well-defined\nformat, possibly a binary format, or as JSON or XML. This structure makes it\neasier to identify and redact specific fields within the log entries.\nFor example, instead of having a flat log message, a structured payload might\nseparate different pieces of information into distinct fields, such as user_id,\ntransaction_id, and timestamp. This separation allows for more precise redaction\nof sensitive data, such as email addresses or credit card numbers, without\naffecting other parts of the log.\n\n##### Why do we need Durable IDs?\n\nDropping or redacting portions of a log involves selectively removing or\nobscuring specific data within log entries to protect sensitive information or\nreduce noise. This practice is crucial for maintaining privacy and security, as\nlogs often contain personal or confidential data such as email addresses, credit\ncard numbers, or API keys. Additionally, dropping unnecessary log entries helps\nin managing log storage efficiently and ensures that only relevant data is\nretained for analysis. See: Logging guidance for .NET library authors. Instead\nof string interpolation, use log message templates, formatting, and\nargument lists.\n\n#### When do the services need to address the problem and what factors contribute to the urgency?\n\n### Monitoring and Reporting\n\nThe security violation would be captured with the below security KPI.\n\n- Type: Action Item\n- Name: Secure High-Performance .NET logging\n- Id:  b0b45691-87f3-4d45-84fe-b39393ec9764\n\n## [How to fix violations](#how-to-fix-violations)\n\nMigrate your code away from using string interpolation to do logging.\nThere are 2 options to do it.
