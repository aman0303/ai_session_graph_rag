The tool validates your derived event by querying the source table data and executing the derived event locally.  It outputs brief execution result on console and writes detailed debugging logs in DerivedEventTest.log.  DerivedEventTest.exe only debugs central derived event, it will fail if the derived event is local, a derived event is deemed local if the data of the source table exists locally on MA, if the source data exists locally and centrally the derived event is default to local derived event, you can add whereToRun=\"Central\" so that the derived event can be debugged, however remove whereToRun=\"Central\" when deploying the config to Geneva Logs.\n\n\n\nTo run and debug a derived event locally you can [run MA on your development box](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/?page=documents&section=9c95f4eb-8689-4c9f-81bf-82d688e860fd&id=893a1992-dd44-4a0e-9be2-e9c894028180).\n\n\n\n**Usage**\n\n\n\nDerivedEventTest.exe  \n        -MdsEndPoint: <mds endpoint>  \n        -ConfigFile: <mds config 2.0 file that defines the derived event, if external source is used,  \n                     also add -ExternalConfigFiles parameter>  \n        -SourceTable: <source table name: this table must have been deployed to mds, it should be full name: [Namespace][EventName][MonikerSuffix]Ver[n]v0>  \n        -DestTable: <dest table name: the task will run in memory, dest table does not have to be deployed to mds, it should be full name: [Namespace][EventName][MonikerSuffix]Ver[n]v0>  \n        -StartTime: <start time of the task, in format: 2014-07-14T00:00:00.0Z>  \n        -EndTime: <end time of the task, in format 2014-07-14T00:00:00.0Z.
