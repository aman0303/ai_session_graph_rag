Each category is then represented by a new string containing the common terms of all messages within the category, as well as wildcards (*) indicating where the input strings differ.\n\n### Algorithm design\n- Preprocess strings by removing numbers and infrequent terms\n- Group similar strings. Two strings are considered similar if their longest common subsequence is longer than a certain threshold.\n- Place small groups into a special category to reduce noise. This category, which we call the *outliers*, is represented by a single wildcard (*).\n\n### Input strings example:\n\n> Starting gateway service.\n> <br>\n> Starting backend service.\n> <br>\n> Request took 109 ms to complete.\n> <br>\n> Request took 87 ms to complete.\n> <br>\n> Backend service found too many error in accounts: foo, bar. Exception: file not found in directory.\n> <br>\n> Backend service found too many error in accounts: xyz. Exception: file not found in directory.\n> <br>\n> ...\n> <br>\n\n#### Preprocess strings\nDuring the preprocessing step, numbers and infrequent terms are removed and replaced by wildcards. An identifier is considered to be frequent if appears in at least 1% of the input messages. This number, called the *support threshold*, might become configurable in future releases.\n\nThe following example shows frequent terms in **bold**.\n\n> **Starting** gateway **service.**\n> <br>\n> **Starting** backend **service.**\n> <br>\n> **Request took** 109 **ms to complete.**\n> <br>\n> **Request took** 87 **ms to complete.**\n> <br>\n> **Backend service found too many error in accounts: foo, bar. Exception: file not found in directory.**\n> <br>\n> **Backend service found too many error in accounts: xyz. Exception: file not found in directory.**\n> <br>\n> ...\n> <br>\n\nThe numbers and infrequent terms are replaced with wildcards and contiguous wildcards are coalesced. \n> Starting * service.\n> <br>\n> Starting * service.\n> <br>\n> Request took * ms to complete.\n> <br>\n> Request took * ms to complete.\n> <br>\n> Backend service found too many error in accounts: foo, bar. Exception: file not found in directory.\n> <br>\n> Backend service found too many error in accounts: xyz. Exception: file not found in directory.\n> <br>\n> ...\n> <br>\n\n#### Groups similar strings\nThe degree of similarity between two strings is determined by how large their longest common subsequence (LCS) is when compared to the longest of them.\n```javascript\nLCS(P1, P2) / Max(length(P1), length(P2)) >= similarity_threshold\n```\nThe *similarity threshold* determines how much commonality there needs to be between strings in the same category. Our implementation uses a similarity threshold of 85%.\n\nFor example, when comparing the following two tokenized strings:\n\n|Backend|service|found|too|many|error|in|accounts|:|foo|,|bar|.|Exception|:|file|not|found|in|directory|.|\n|-------|-------|-----|---|----|-----|--|--------|-|---|-|---|-|---------|-|----|---|-----|--|---------|-|\n\n|Backend|service|found|too|many|error|in|accounts|:|xyz|.|Exception|:|file|not|found|in|directory|.|\n|-------|-------|-----|---|----|-----|--|--------|-|---|-|---------|-|----|---|-----|--|---------|-|\n\n\nWe find the following LCS:\n\n|Backend|service|found|too|many|error|in|accounts|:|.|Exception|:|file|not|found|in|directory|.|\n|-------|-------|-----|---|----|-----|--|--------|-|-|---------|-|----|---|-----|--|---------|-|\n\nWhich meets the similarity threshold:\n```javascript\nLCS(P1, P2) / Max(length(P1), length(P2)) == 18 / Max(21, 19) = 85.7%\n```\n\nSo these input strings are placed in the same category:\n> Backend service found too many error in accounts: *. Exception: file not found in directory.\n> <br>\n\n#### Place small groups into the outliers category to reduce noise\nCategories containing less han 1% of the input strings are grouped into a special category called *outliers*. This category is represented as a single wildcard (*).\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Display categories by frequency\nThis example uses the *summarize* operator to display distinct categories along with the number of messages in each category.\n\n```javascript\nsource\n| categorize Message into Category\n| summarize count() by Category\n```\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CATEGORIZE OPERATOR<|>SERVICE<|>The categorize operator is a service that categorizes strings by similarity and creates a pattern highlighting common parts of each category.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INPUT TABLE<|>PARAMETER<|>The input table is a mandatory parameter that provides the data to be categorized by the categorize operator.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPRESSION<|>PARAMETER<|>The expression is a mandatory string expression that defines the criteria for categorization within the categorize operator.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLUMNNAME<|>PARAMETER<|>ColumnName is a mandatory name of the new column that will contain the categories generated by the categorize operator.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMILARITY THRESHOLD<|>PARAMETER<|>The similarity threshold is a configurable parameter that determines the minimum commonality required for strings to be categorized together.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OUTLIERS CATEGORY<|>PARAMETER<|>The outliers category is a special category for small groups of strings that do not meet the frequency threshold, represented by a single wildcard (*).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LCS<|>QUERY<|>LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) is a query used to determine the degree of similarity between two strings based on their common subsequence length.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATEGORIZE OPERATOR<|>INPUT TABLE<|>The categorize operator processes the input table to categorize the strings based on similarity.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATEGORIZE OPERATOR<|>EXPRESSION<|>The categorize operator requires an expression to define how the categorization should be performed.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATEGORIZE OPERATOR<|>COLUMNNAME<|>The categorize operator creates a new column, specified by ColumnName, to store the resulting categories.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATEGORIZE OPERATOR<|>SIMILARITY THRESHOLD<|>The categorize operator uses the similarity threshold to determine how similar strings must be to be grouped together.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATEGORIZE OPERATOR<|>OUTLIERS CATEGORY<|>The categorize operator identifies small groups of strings as outliers and categorizes them under the outliers category.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LCS<|>SIMILARITY THRESHOLD<|>The LCS query is used to calculate the similarity between strings, which is compared against the similarity threshold for categorization.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
