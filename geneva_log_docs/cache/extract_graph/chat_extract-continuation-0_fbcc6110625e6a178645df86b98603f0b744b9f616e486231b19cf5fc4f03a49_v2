To complete the migration to GSM, and to be fully compliant with [Immutable Logs](../Compliance/ImmutableLogs.md), you're required to delete the legacy non-GSM configurations and resources from them. \n\n## How to identify hybrid accounts\n\nIn [Account > Logs Account Settings > Account](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/account/logs/account), and select your account. The message should display: \"This account is in a hybrid state\".\n\n![HybridAccount](../images/HybridAccount.png)\n\n## How to delete legacy configurations from your hybrid account\n\n### 1. Idenitfy GSM configurations in your account\n\n1. Go to the **Resources** tab\n2. Click **Show Storage groups by Namespace**. \n3. Choose a **Namespace** from the **Namespace** dropdown menue, and find the configuration versions under **Geneva Managed Configuration** secetion in the **Configuration Version** dropdown menu. *Take note* of these configuration versions.  \n\n![GSMConfigs](../images/GSMConfigs.png)\n\n\n### 2. Make sure only GSM configurations are deployed on your monitoring agents \n\n1. In Jarivs, go to **Agent**\n2. Click **Explorer** to access [Agent Explorer](../../../collect/troubleshoot/agentexplorer.md). \n3. Choose the **Endpoint**, your **Account** and your **Namespace**. \n4. Choose the **Agent identities** from the side menu. \n5. Review the **Config Version** column.\n6. Verify that the GSM configurations you identified in the [previous step](UpdateHybridAccount.md#1-idenitfy-gsm-configurations-in-your-account) are deployed on the monitoring agents. \n\n![AgentExplorerGSM](../images/AgentExplorerGSM.png)\n\nIf one or more of your monitoring agents have non-GSM configurations deployed, please update them to a GSM configuration version following the steps [here](../Manageconfig/configmanagement.md#pushing-configuration-changes-to-your-service). \n\n>[!Note]\n>Service teams are required to ensure Geneva configuration updates go through Safe Deployment Practices (SDP). Make sure to start with a small number of agents to ensure the configuration is validated and producing the desired results. Go to [the GCS migration guide](MigrateToGCS.md#safe-deployment-practices-sdp) to learn more. \n\n\n>[!Note]\n>You will have to repeat these steps for each agent in each one of your namespaces to ensure only GSM configurations are deployed in your account. \n\n### 3. Delete non-GSM configurations\n\n>[!Note]\n>Once you delete configurations from your account, you'll no longer be able to query telemetry data collected with these configurations in DGrep. If you still need access to the data, wait until your data retention policy expires before deleting the configurations and the monikers. \n\nOnce you ensured that the non-GSM configs are not deployed on any monitoring agents, and you confirmed you no longer need access to the logs, go to the **Configurations** tab in your account, find the configuration you want to delete, and click on the three dot icon to find the **Delete** button. \n\n![DeleteConfig](../images/DeleteConfig.png)\n\n### 4. Delete non-GSM resources\nOnce the non-GSM configs were deleted, you can delete the non-GSM monikers. Follow the steps in [this guide](monikerdelete.md) to delete the monikers. *Take note* of the storage account and Event Hub names so you can delete them from your subscription. \n\nOnce the monikers were deleted, you can go to Azure Portal delete the storage accounts and Event Hubs associated with these monikers. Note that you may have to wait until the [immutability policy](../Compliance/ImmutableLogs.md) expires before being able to delete storage accounts used to store audit and security logs.\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS HYBRID ACCOUNTS<|>TENANT<|>Geneva Logs hybrid accounts are accounts that are enabled for Geneva Storage Management (GSM) but still contain legacy, non-GSM configurations and resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA STORAGE MANAGEMENT<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Storage Management (GSM) is a service that provides enhanced management capabilities for Geneva Logs accounts, ensuring compliance and efficient resource handling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMMUTABLE LOGS<|>EVENT<|>Immutable Logs are a compliance feature that ensures log data cannot be altered or deleted, providing a secure audit trail for Geneva Logs accounts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMESPACE<|>CONFIGURATION<|>A Namespace in Geneva Logs is a logical grouping that helps organize and manage configurations and resources effectively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GSM CONFIGURATIONS<|>CONFIGURATION<|>GSM configurations are specific settings and resources that comply with Geneva Storage Management standards, ensuring proper functionality and compliance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING AGENTS<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>Monitoring agents are components that collect and report telemetry data from Geneva Logs accounts, ensuring that configurations are correctly deployed and functioning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFIGURATION VERSION<|>PARAMETER<|>Configuration Version refers to the specific iteration of a configuration that is deployed within a Namespace, allowing for version control and management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAFE DEPLOYMENT PRACTICES<|>EVENT<|>Safe Deployment Practices (SDP) are guidelines that service teams must follow to ensure that configuration updates are validated and do not disrupt service operations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS HYBRID ACCOUNTS<|>GENEVA STORAGE MANAGEMENT<|>Geneva Logs hybrid accounts are designed to be migrated to GSM for enhanced management and compliance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA STORAGE MANAGEMENT<|>IMMUTABLE LOGS<|>GSM ensures that log data adheres to the Immutable Logs compliance requirements, providing a secure audit trail.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS HYBRID ACCOUNTS<|>NAMESPACE<|>Hybrid accounts utilize Namespaces to organize and manage their configurations and resources effectively.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAMESPACE<|>GSM CONFIGURATIONS<|>Namespaces contain GSM configurations that are necessary for compliance and proper functionality within Geneva Logs.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING AGENTS<|>GSM CONFIGURATIONS<|>Monitoring agents must have GSM configurations deployed to ensure they are compliant and functioning correctly.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONFIGURATION VERSION<|>MONITORING AGENTS<|>Monitoring agents report on the Configuration Version to ensure that the correct settings are in use.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAFE DEPLOYMENT PRACTICES<|>MONITORING AGENTS<|>Safe Deployment Practices require monitoring agents to be updated in a controlled manner to validate configurations before full deployment.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
