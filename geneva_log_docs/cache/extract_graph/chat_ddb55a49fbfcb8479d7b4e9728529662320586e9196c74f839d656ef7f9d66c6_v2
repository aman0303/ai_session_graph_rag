Follow the instructions in this page in order to start using Configuration Update tool in case you do not meet any prerequisites.\n\n#### Manage Plans for Configuration Update\nOnce you pass all prerequisite checks you will be able to create and execute update plans in the tool. The plans you create can be used to both update configurations or Monitoring Agents.\n\nAn update plan comprises of phases that are executed sequentially with wait times between phases where the health of the updated agents are validated. You should create plans such that the initial phases of the plan start with a small number of agents that are lower in terms of importance (e.g. in canary regions), and add phases that progressively grow to include larger number of agents.\n\nThe \"Show Topology\" button can be used to pick a set of agents that you want to be included as part of the phase.\n\n#### Executing a plan\nOnce you have created a plan, you can execute it by switching to the Config Update Pane as shown below. \n\n![Execute plan][ExecutePlanImage]\n\n## Linux support for configuration management\n\nConfiguration Builder is supported for Linux for the following features:\n- Global settings\n- Event streaming settings\n- Local development box testing\n\nConfiguration Update tool is currently not available for Linux environment. \n\n<!-- Reference links -->\n[JarvisPortal]: https://aka.ms/Jarvis \"Jarvis portal\"\n\n<!-- Image links -->\n[ManageConfigurations]: ../images/Configurations.png \"Manage configurations\"\n[GlobalSettingsImage]: ../images/GlobalSettings.png \"Global settings\"\n[WhatToCollectImage]: ../images/WhatToCollect.png \"What to collect?\"\n[EventStreamingImage]: ../images/EventStreaming.png \"Event streaming settings\"\n[ConfigurationXMLImage]: ../images/ConfigurationXML.png \"Configuration XML\"\n[AgentLauncherImage]: ../images/AgentLauncher.png \"Agent launch settings\"\n[ConfigurationUpdateImage]: ../images/ConfigurationUpdate.png \"Configuration Update tool\"\n[ExecutePlanImage]: ../images/ExecutePlan.png \"Execute plan\"\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ddb55a49fbfcb8479d7b4e9728529662320586e9196c74f839d656ef7f9d66c6_v2"}
