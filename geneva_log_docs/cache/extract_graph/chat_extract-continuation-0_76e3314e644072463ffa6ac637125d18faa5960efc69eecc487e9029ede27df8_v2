Central Derived Events are deprecated except for billing scenarios. Please refer to [this document ](../../../alerts/alertingfrom.md)for an overview of our available alternate aggregation solutions. Most simple aggregation needs can be met through Geneva Metrics either directly or via Local Derived Events.\n\nThe Monitoring Agent and the central Geneva services can perform aggregation, filtering and projection of event stream data by executing Derived Events. Derived Events that are executed by the Monitoring Agent are referred to as \"Locally Derived Events.\" Derived Events executed in our central Geneva services are referred to as \"Centrally Derived Events.\" For example\n\n| | ​Local | ​Central |\n| ---------- | ---------- | --------------|\n| Aggregation​ | Count the number of times a particular event happened on the VM running the MA | Calculate the average utilization for a resource (i.e. CPU) across all role instances making up a Role |\n| ​Filtering | ​Create a new event stream that does not contain PII that existed in the original event stream | ​Create a new event stream that contains all Critical or Severe level errors across your Role or Service |\n| ​Projection | Generate a histogram representing statistical distribution of the performance of a particular operation | ​Aggregate histogram information across your Role |\n\nDerived events are defined in your MA Config. One thing to stress is that for your derived events based off of locally collected data, that run within your MA process, you need to **include all of your identity component field names in your groupby and select clauses**. Note that centrally run derived events is a [deprecated feature](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/?page=documents&section=6cf6b99f-0a65-4d86-a639-c191e731084c&id=5338e00e-dd82-4b5b-96be-963196e4776b). MA or locally run derived events are fully supported. The algorithm for deciding where to run a derived event is as follows\n\n\n\n> if (the source's **storeType**is Local)\n> \n> \n> \n> > run it locally\n> \n> \n> \n> else if (**whereToRun**is defined)\n> \n> \n> \n> > run it accordingly\n> \n> \n> \n> else if (query has groupby)\n> \n> \n> \n> > if (groupby columns include all the identity columns)\n> > \n> > \n> > \n> > > run it locally\n> > \n> > \n> > \n> > else\n> > \n> > \n> > \n> > > run it centrally\n> \n> \n> \n> else\n> \n> \n> \n> > run it locally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Duration\n\n\nThe frequency or interval that a derived event is run, is specified using the *duration* attribute in your MA configuration file. You can find [more information about that here](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/?page=documents&section=9c95f4eb-8689-4c9f-81bf-82d688e860fd&id=ac0084ad-5065-4b16-8f7d-0a5193143378#/).\n\n\n### Default Columns\n\n\n| ​Column Name | ​Description | ​Central | CentralBond |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ​N | ​The partition load spread. See the comments for the \"[eventVolume](http://jarvis-east-int.cloudapp.net/?page=documents&section=9c95f4eb-8689-4c9f-81bf-82d688e860fd&id=8794f47e-d1b2-4538-8f31-839c41c1710a)\" attribute for more details (only if Azure table format is used - i.e. not relevant for CentralBond format) | Yes​ | No​ |\n| ​PreciseTimeStamp | ​The time the event was logged if the query is not an aggregation. This column is not available to reference in a MA run derived event query, but added as a field post-query. | ​Yes | ​No |\n| ​RowIndex | ​A value that ensures the row is unique within the rows emitted by one execution of this query (only if Azure table format is used - i.e. not relevant for CentralBond format) | ​Yes | ​No |\n| ​Tenant | ​Comes from the source event for central and the MA identity for local, assuming TenantRole is the identity. | Yes​ | Yes​ |\n| ​Role | ​​Comes from the source event for central and the MA identity for local, assuming TenantRole is the identity. | Yes​ | Yes​ |\n| ​RoleInstance | ​Comes from the source event for central and the MA identity for local, assuming TenantRole is the identity. | Yes​ | Yes​ |\n| TIMESTAMP | \n\nWhen looking at your data in Jarvis DGrep this is the time rounded to the duration you are pushing the data to storage. Use PreciseTimeStamp for the time the event is logged.\n\n\n\nIf you are running a derived event query locally in MA and need to reference the time the event was logged, use this as a the keyword to resolve to the UTC typed timestamp for the logged event.\n\n | Yes | Yes |\n| PartitionKey | Partition key for Azure Table (Central) format | Yes | No |\n| RowKey | RowKey for Azure Table format, but we also included it in CentralBond for a now deprecated CentralBond blob format to Central Azure Table format scenario. | Yes | Yes |\n\n\n## Derived Event Testing\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DERIVED EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>Derived Events are events that are generated based on the aggregation, filtering, and projection of event stream data, either locally or centrally, to provide insights into system performance and behavior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL DERIVED EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>Local Derived Events are derived events executed by the Monitoring Agent, focusing on data collected locally on the virtual machine.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL DERIVED EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>Central Derived Events are derived events executed in central Geneva services, primarily used for billing scenarios and broader data aggregation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>The Monitoring Agent is a component that collects data and executes derived events locally, performing aggregation, filtering, and projection of event stream data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA SERVICES<|>SERVICE<|>Central Geneva services provide capabilities for processing and analyzing event data, including executing derived events for broader insights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MA CONFIG<|>CONFIGURATION<|>MA Config is the configuration file used by the Monitoring Agent to define how derived events are executed and what parameters are included.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURATION<|>PARAMETER<|>Duration is an attribute in the MA configuration file that specifies the frequency or interval at which a derived event is run.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFAULT COLUMNS<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Default Columns are predefined columns in derived event queries that provide essential information about the events being processed, such as timestamps and identifiers.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOCAL DERIVED EVENTS<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>Local Derived Events are executed by the Monitoring Agent, which collects and processes local data for event generation.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRAL DERIVED EVENTS<|>GENEVA SERVICES<|>Central Derived Events are executed within the central Geneva services, which manage and analyze event data on a larger scale.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MA CONFIG<|>The Monitoring Agent uses the MA Config to determine how derived events are executed and what data to include in the processing.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DURATION<|>MA CONFIG<|>The duration attribute in the MA Config specifies how often derived events should be executed, linking the two entities closely.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEFAULT COLUMNS<|>MA CONFIG<|>Default Columns are defined in the MA Config to standardize the output of derived event queries, ensuring consistency in data representation.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
