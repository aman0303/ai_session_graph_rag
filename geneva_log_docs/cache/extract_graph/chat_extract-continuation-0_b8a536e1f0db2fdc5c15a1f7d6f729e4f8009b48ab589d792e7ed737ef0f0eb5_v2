The FAQ below contains information that broadly applies to all diagnostics applications (e.g., availability in all regions, onboarding etc).\n\n## What types of events show up in DGrep?\n\nEvents configured with type CentralBond or those that have streaming annotations will be searchable via DGrep.\n\n## Will my data be duplicated and doubled the storage capacity?\n\nEvents configured using storage type (e.g. storeType= ) __Local__ or __CentralBond__ will not result in a double upload of data if you create an event stream on the event. By default derived event storage type is __Central__ and the default non-derived event storage type is __Local__. Geneva Logs central storage types that are not CentralBond will result in a double data upload if an event streaming annotation is added. Note that the __CentralBond__ storage type is only supported on data uploaded from MA. See the Geneva Logs configuration documents for more details. CentralBond format is strongly recommended.\n\n## Can I use streaming annotations on derived events?\n\nYes, but the storeType for the derived event must be set to either __Local__ or __CentralBond__. We only recommend annotations for CentralBond, however, since there are some scenarios that don't work if you use Local. For example, you can't specify an alternative storage group for an event if it is local and more event loss to the Geneva pipeline is expected if you combine annotations and Local. This feature is only supported on derived events run locally by MA; it is not supported with derived events run in the central Geneva Logs service.\n\n## What types of events support streaming annotations?\n\nAll MA event types support streaming annotations, but there are some restrictions on derived and dynamic event types.\n\n* DerivedEvents - The MA configured storeType must be either Local or CentralBond.\n* DynamicEvents - The MA configured storeType must be CentralBond.\n* Other Events - If the storeType is not Local or CentralBond, MA will upload the data twice since the data pipeline only works with the CentralBond storeType format.\n\n## How do I rotate my storage and Service Bus keys in Geneva Logs?\n\nYou can find the information to rotate your storage and Service Bus keys [here](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/documents?page=documents&section=1363da01-b6ed-43d4-970e-f89b011d591f&id=cd4ab5d0-ea70-4f81-874f-5848d4936b38).\n\n## How do I resolve errors when configuring a security group for a new Logs account?\n\nSee the [guidance here](../Howtoguides/Manageconfig/securitygroups.md#faq) for various errors that you may come across when onboarding.\n\n## How can I search for a Logs account if I don't know its name?\n\nYou can search for a Logs account by using a subscription ID, namespace, configuration ID or a moniker name.\n\n* Navigate to [Jarvis -> Account -> Logs Account Settings][LogsAccount] -> Authenticate and select endpoint & account\n* Go to __Search__, and use the dropdown menu to choose your search option.\n\n    ![SearchAccount](../images/SearchAccount.png)\n\n* Using [mds.exe](https://msblox.visualstudio.com/Azure%20Geneva%20Monitoring%20and%20Diagnostics%20Pipeline/_packaging?_a=package&feed=AzureGenevaMonitoring&package=MDS-Tools&protocolType=NuGet), run the following command:\n\n    ```\n    mds.exe account <endpoint> -command:findowner -kind:<Namespace|Storage|AccountSubscription|MonikerSubscription> -name:pattern\n    ```\n\n## How do I share Logs Account links?\n\n1. Navigate to [Jarvis -> Account -> Logs Account Settings][LogsAccount] -> Authenticate and select endpoint & account\n2. Go to the page of your choice to share link Configurations, Resources, Account etc.\n3. Click on __Share__ button on top right corner (below profile icon) of your desired page\n4. Click on Copy icon of short link and share it.\n\n![LogsManageShareLink][LogsManageShareLink]\n\n## How do I update the certificates that are already expired or expiring soon?\n\n### Steps to identify the fleet machines which are using expired/expiring certificates\n\nIf your team have received an alert incident from Secrets Management/IcM Generation team  by Automation [GenevaActions-ExpiryCertsIcms](https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v5/automation/workflows/GenevaActions-ExpiryCertsIcms) with the title contains `[Action Required] An In-Use Certificate is expiring in < 25 days: STID: <<Service Tree GUID>> : <<Service Name>>` then please download attached .HTML file (InUseExpiringCerts.html) from the incident and check for below details:\n\n1. Thumbprint\n2. ExpirationDate\n3. CertIssuer\n4. CertIssuer\n5. ScanDate\n\n![CertExpirySample][CertExpirySample]\n\nPlease follow below mentioned steps to find out which machine from the fleet of servers is using the expired/near expiry certificate, by taking the `ScanDate` and search for thumbprint with + or - 1 hour time interval in the below DGrep queries:\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The below process will only show the servers/machines which are successfully communicating with GCS.\n \n1.
