In the worst case, the number of blobs per second for a given event is the product of the number of Monitoring Agent instances uploading that event and the event upload frequency.\n* Number of metrics emitted per second\n* Computation units per second: This is a measure of the computational resources used to convert logs to metrics. Technically, each computation unit corresponds to 1 millisecond of CPU time. This metric is determined by the number of processed bytes per second and the complexity of the conversion logic (for example, regular expressions are usually more expensive than simple equality filtering).\n\nEach of those dimensions has separate limits per rule and per Logs namespace. If a rule limit is exceeded, that rule is sampled, but other rules on the same Logs namespace are not affected. If a namespace limit is exceeded, all rules in that namespace are sampled.\n\nDimensions | Per rule | Per namespace\n--- | --- | ---\nBytes/s | 250 MB/s | 500 MB/s\nBlobs/s | 2,500 | 5,000\nMetrics/s | 250,000 | 500,000\nComputation units/s | 25,000 | 50,000\n\nHere is an example of how these limits might be applied:\n\nSuppose that there are three LogsToMetrics rules in a Logs namespace. The number of blobs/s to be processed by each rule is R1: 3125, R2: 1400 and R3: 1650.\n\nRule R1 exceeds the per-rule blob/s limit, so it will be sampled at a `2500/3125 = 0.8` rate (i.e., only 80% of blobs will be processed by that rule).\n\nAfter rule R1 is sampled, the overall number of blob/s in the namespace is `0.8*3125+1400+1650 = 5,550`, which is still above the per-namespace limit. So we apply an additional sampling on the entire namespace at rate `5000/5550 = 0.9`.\n\nThe result is that rule R1 is sampled at a rate of `0.8*0.9 = 0.72` (so it processes `3125*0.72 = 2250` blob/s) and R2 and R3 are sampled at rate 0.90 (processing `1400*0.9 = 1260` and `1650*0.9=1485` blobs/s, respectively).\n\n>[!Note]\n>These quotas can by adjusted per Logs namespace with proper business justification.\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>SERVICE<|>LogsToMetrics is a service that enforces quotas on log data processing across various dimensions such as bytes per second, blobs per second, metrics emitted per second, and computation units per second.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>Monitoring Agent instances are responsible for uploading log events to the LogsToMetrics service, impacting the number of blobs processed per second.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGS NAMESPACE<|>NAMESPACE<|>A Logs namespace is a logical container for organizing and managing logs, where specific limits and quotas are applied to rules within it.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RULE<|>CONFIGURATION<|>A rule in the context of LogsToMetrics defines the parameters and conditions under which log data is processed and sampled.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTATION UNITS<|>PARAMETER<|>Computation units are a measure of computational resources used in processing logs, with each unit corresponding to 1 millisecond of CPU time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BYTES PER SECOND<|>PARAMETER<|>Bytes per second is a metric that indicates the volume of log data being processed, with specific limits set for both per rule and per namespace.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOBS PER SECOND<|>PARAMETER<|>Blobs per second refers to the number of individual log entries stored in Azure blob storage that can be processed within a given timeframe.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METRICS EMITTED PER SECOND<|>PARAMETER<|>Metrics emitted per second is a measure of the number of metrics generated from log data processing, subject to defined limits.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>The LogsToMetrics service relies on Monitoring Agent instances to upload log events, which directly affects the processing of blobs per second.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>LOGS NAMESPACE<|>LogsToMetrics enforces specific limits and quotas on log processing within a defined Logs namespace.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGS NAMESPACE<|>RULE<|>Rules are defined within a Logs namespace and are subject to the limits imposed by the namespace for processing logs.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RULE<|>BYTES PER SECOND<|>Each rule has a specific limit on bytes per second that it can process, which is monitored by the LogsToMetrics service.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RULE<|>BLOBS PER SECOND<|>Rules in the LogsToMetrics service are limited by the number of blobs per second they can process, impacting overall log management.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>COMPUTATION UNITS<|>LogsToMetrics uses computation units to measure the computational resources required for processing logs, which is critical for performance monitoring.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>METRICS EMITTED PER SECOND<|>The LogsToMetrics service tracks the number of metrics emitted per second as part of its log processing capabilities.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
