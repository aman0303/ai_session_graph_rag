Additional information is available in the \"Service Admins\" section above.\n\n### Will users require JIT access to view logs?\n\nAt present, JIT is not required for access to logs in a production environment. In the future Geneva Account owners will have the ability to require JIT on a per-namespace basis. Additional information and instructions will be provided when that feature is available.\n\n### Can I view my Fairfax logs using a Torus account?\n\nWe are aware of a nuance which does not allow Fairfax logs to be viewed using a Torus account. Users are advised to obtain a *ME card/credentials to maintain access. Information on *ME account setup is available at [MFA Account Creation](https://aka.ms/amecard).\n\n### Will I need a SAW to view Geneva Logs?\n\nFurther guidance of safely accessing telemetry data is coming. We will update this wiki as soon as additional information is available.\n\n### How is this related to the Kusto Security Hardening effort?\n\nAlthough similar in nature, this effort is separate from the Kusto Security Hardening effort.
