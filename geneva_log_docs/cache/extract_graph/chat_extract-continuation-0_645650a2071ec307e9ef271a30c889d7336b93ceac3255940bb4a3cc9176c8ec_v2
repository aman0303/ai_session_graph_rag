Security Groups, Users and Certificates are the supported as role members. \n\nWhen a Log account is created, two user roles are automatically created. One user role is created for account administration. This user role will start with __MdsAccountAdmin__ followed by your account name. Another user role is created for the Monitoring Agents in your service to communicate with Geneva. This user role will start with __MACommunication__. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are migrating to GCS the MACommunication role is created as part of migration. Additional MACommunication roles can be created as required if you want to use different MA-Geneva communication certificates for different namespaces. Follow the below steps to create additional MACommunication roles using the UX:\n> - Go to Manage\\Logs\n> - Locate your account ( provide endpoint and account name)\n> - Navigate to user roles tab\n> - Click on \"View/Edit\" for the &lt;acctname>_MaCommunication Role that you are enabling GCS on.\n> - Select kind as Agent\n> - Enter namespace name:  ^YourNamespace.*\n> - Select Execute as claim\n> - Hit Add button\n> - It may take up to an hour for this to take effect\n\nYou will be required to provide either a Security Group or a set of Users to be designated as your account's administrators. The Security Groups that are assigned to User Roles require to be onboarded to an authentication service called dSTS. Security Groups can be registered with dSTS through the onboarding wizard or through the manageability UX.\n\nYou will be required to register one or more authentication certificates with the MACommunication role. These certificates (along with their private key) can be used by the Monitoring Agents to authenticate with Geneva. \n\nAdditional user roles can be set up to provide finer-grained access control to other users and/or certificates as required.\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>USER ROLE<|>ROLE<|>A User Role represents a collection of permissions granted to members, including Security Groups, Users, and Certificates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MDSACCOUNTADMIN<|>ROLE<|>The MdsAccountAdmin role is automatically created for account administration, starting with the prefix MdsAccountAdmin followed by the account name.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOMMUNICATION<|>ROLE<|>The MACommunication role is created for Monitoring Agents to communicate with Geneva, starting with the prefix MACommunication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOG ACCOUNT<|>TENANT<|>A Log account is a tenant that allows for the management and storage of log data within the system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMESPACE<|>NAMESPACE<|>A Namespace is a designated area within the system that organizes and manages log data and roles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DSTS<|>SERVICE<|>dSTS is an authentication service that Security Groups must be onboarded to in order to be assigned to User Roles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHENTICATION CERTIFICATES<|>PARAMETER<|>Authentication certificates are used by Monitoring Agents to authenticate with Geneva, requiring registration with the MACommunication role.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER ROLE<|>MDSACCOUNTADMIN<|>The User Role includes the MdsAccountAdmin role as part of the permissions granted for account administration.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER ROLE<|>MACOMMUNICATION<|>The User Role includes the MACommunication role for Monitoring Agents to facilitate communication with Geneva.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOG ACCOUNT<|>USER ROLE<|>When a Log account is created, user roles are automatically generated for managing permissions within that account.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACOMMUNICATION<|>NAMESPACE<|>The MACommunication role can be associated with different namespaces for managing communication certificates.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY GROUPS<|>DSTS<|>Security Groups assigned to User Roles must be registered with the dSTS authentication service.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACOMMUNICATION<|>AUTHENTICATION CERTIFICATES<|>The MACommunication role requires registration of authentication certificates for Monitoring Agents to authenticate with Geneva.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
