The type of a real literal is Double. A real literal implicitly converts to any other real type provided the number is in the range of that type. Some examples of real literals:\n\n```javascript\n1.0   2.25   10000.0   1e0   1e10   1.2345E-4\n```\n\nA string literal consists of zero or more characters enclosed in double quotes. Inside a string literal, a double quote is written as two consecutive double quotes. The type of a string literal is String. Some examples of string literals:\n\n```javascript\n\"hello\"   \"\"    \"\"\"quoted\"\"\"   \"'\"\n```\n\nA character literal consists of a single character enclosed in single quotes. Inside a character literal, a single quote is written as two consecutive single quotes. The type of a character literal is Char. Some examples of character literals:\n\n```javascript\n'A'   '1'   ''''   '\"'\n```\n\n## Constants\nThe predefined constants **true** and **false** denote the two values of the type Boolean.\n\n## Types\nThe expression language defines the following primitive types:\n\n\n```csharp\nObject     Boolean    Char      String        SByte         Byte\nInt16      UInt16     Int32     UInt32        Int64         UInt64\nDecimal    Single     Double    DateTime      TimeSpan      Guid\n```\n\nThe primitive types correspond to the similarly named types in the System namespace of the .NET Framework Base Class Library. The expression language also defines a set of accessible types consisting of the primitive types and the following types:\n\n```csharp\nSystem.Math\nSystem.Convert\nSystem.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex\n```\n\nThe accessible types are the only types that can be explicitly referenced in expressions, and method invocations in the expression language are restricted to 1) methods declared in the accessible types, 2) aggregate functions on sequence types (aka enumerable types) and 3) monitoring extension methods.\n\n(Note: When using the accessible types above, you do not need to specify the namespace.)\n\nThe types SByte, Byte, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Int64, and UInt64 are collectively called the integral types.\n\nThe types Single, Double, and Decimal are collectively called the __real types__.\n\nThe integral types and real types are collectively called the __numeric types__.\n\n## Conditional Expressions\nThe conditional operator (?:) returns one of two values depending on the value of a Boolean expression. Following is the syntax for the conditional operator:\n\n```javascript\ncondition ? first_expression : second_expression\n```\niif keyword is a shorthand for the conditional operator. Following is the syntax for iif:\n\n```javascript\niif (condition, first_expresion, second_expression)\n```\n### Examples\n```javascript\nMessage != null ? Message : \"\"\niif (Message != null, Message, \"\")\n```\n\n## Conversions\nThe following conversions are implicitly performed by the expression language:\n\n* From an integer literal to an integral type or real type provided the number is within the range of that type.\n* From a real literal to a real type provided the number is within the range of that type.\n* From a source type that is assignment compatible with the target type according to the Type.IsAssignableFrom method in .NET.\n* From a numeric type to another numeric type with greater range.\n\nThe expression language permits explicit conversions using the syntax type(expr), where type is a type name and expr is an expression. This syntax may be used to perform the following conversions:\n* Between two types provided Type.IsAssignableFrom is true in one or both directions.\n* Between any two types belonging to the set consisting of SByte, Byte, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Int64, UInt64, Decimal, Single, Double, Char.\nIn addition, you can use the Convert class or the Parse method on the supported types to convert from one type to another. Examples:\n\n```javascript\nlet intValue = Int32.Parse(\"11\")\nlet doubleValue = Convert.ToDouble(\"11.2\")\n```\n\n## Searching the entire row\nThe expression it.Any(arg) evaluates to a boolean value indicating whether any column in the current row contains the string produced by evaluating the argument arg. This method uses case insensitive comparison to find matching substrings. For example, the query below returns rows that contain the string \"foo\" in any column.\n\n```javascript\nwhere it.Any(\"foo\")\n```\n\n## Method and Constructor Invocations\nThe expression language limits invocation of methods and constructors to those declared public in the accessible types. This restriction exists to protect against unintended side effects from invocation of arbitrary methods.\n\nIn addition, the expression language also allows invocation of aggregate functions or extension methods.\n\nThe expression language permits getting (but not setting) the value of any reachable public field, or property.\n\nOverload resolution for methods, constructors, and indexers uses rules similar to C#. In informal terms, overload resolution will pick the best matching method, or constructor, or report an ambiguity error if no single best match can be identified.\n\nNote that constructor invocations are not prefixed by new. The following example creates a DateTime instance for a specfic year, month, and day using a constructor invocation:\n\n```javascript\nTIMESTAMP >= DateTime(2009, 1, 1)\n```\n\n## Working with Strings\nA string literal consists of zero or more characters enclosed in double quotes. Inside a string literal, a double quote is written (escaped) as two consecutive double quotes. All public methods and properties exposed by System.String except the overrides using enums such as StringComparison are supported. In addition, the following extension methods are usable as well:\n\n|Method|Description|\n|------|-----------|\n|ContainsI(string value)| Case insensitive version of string.Contains method.|\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>REAL LITERAL<|>PARAMETER<|>A real literal is a numeric value that can be represented in decimal or exponential notation, and its type is Double.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRING LITERAL<|>PARAMETER<|>A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, representing text data, with specific rules for including double quotes within the string.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARACTER LITERAL<|>PARAMETER<|>A character literal consists of a single character enclosed in single quotes, representing a single character value.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOOLEAN<|>PARAMETER<|>Boolean is a data type that can hold one of two values: true or false.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIMITIVE TYPES<|>NAMESPACE<|>Primitive types are the basic data types defined in the expression language, including Object, Boolean, Char, String, and various numeric types.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCESSIBLE TYPES<|>NAMESPACE<|>Accessible types are the set of types that can be explicitly referenced in expressions, including primitive types and specific .NET types like System.Math and System.Convert.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NUMERIC TYPES<|>NAMESPACE<|>Numeric types are a collective term for integral types and real types used in the expression language for numerical operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDITIONAL OPERATOR<|>COMMAND<|>The conditional operator (?:) is used to return one of two values based on the evaluation of a Boolean expression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IIF<|>COMMAND<|>The iif keyword is a shorthand for the conditional operator, allowing for concise conditional expressions in the expression language.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVERSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Conversions refer to the implicit and explicit transformations between different data types in the expression language.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEARCHING<|>COMMAND<|>The searching method it.Any(arg) evaluates whether any column in the current row contains a specified string, using case insensitive comparison.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METHOD AND CONSTRUCTOR INVOCATIONS<|>EVENT<|>Method and constructor invocations are limited to public methods in accessible types, ensuring controlled execution of methods in the expression language.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REAL LITERAL<|>BOOLEAN<|>Real literals can be used in expressions that evaluate to Boolean values, such as comparisons or conditions.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STRING LITERAL<|>CHARACTER LITERAL<|>String literals can contain character literals, as they are both types of literals used to represent data in the expression language.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRIMITIVE TYPES<|>ACCESSIBLE TYPES<|>Primitive types are included in the set of accessible types that can be referenced in expressions.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NUMERIC TYPES<|>PRIMITIVE TYPES<|>Numeric types are a subset of primitive types, specifically focusing on types used for numerical calculations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONDITIONAL OPERATOR<|>IIF<|>The iif keyword is a shorthand version of the conditional operator, providing a simplified syntax for conditional expressions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONVERSIONS<|>NUMERIC TYPES<|>Conversions often involve numeric types, as they can be transformed between different numeric representations.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEARCHING<|>METHOD AND CONSTRUCTOR INVOCATIONS<|>Searching methods can invoke public methods defined in accessible types, allowing for data retrieval based on conditions.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
