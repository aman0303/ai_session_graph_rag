[This article](../Howtoguides/Manageaccount/FailoverMonikers.md) provides more information on moniker failover scenarios. \n \nThere are a few ways that you can confirm if this is the cause of your missing moniker: \n* In [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the subscription in question, and try to create a storage account or Event Hub in that region manually; if you are unable/get an error, it's likely the same reason that GSM is failing.\n* Alternatively, you can examine this [DGrep query](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/s/B869BF51) used by the Geneva Warm Path team. Customize the time window to when your agents last tried to communicate with GCS, and then search for your MDS account name in the client query window. If you see a message similar to this, then it is due to not being authorized to provision resources for that region:  \n\n```\nError adding moniker MdsAccount: <MdsAccountName>, Moniker: <MdsMonikerName>, Location: brazilsoutheast, StorageGroup: <MdsStorageGroupName>, StorageAccount: , EventHub: , Subscription: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000, ResourceGroup: ,IsPatchRequest: False,IsDisabled: False: System.AggregateException: Storage or service bus account creation failed ---> Microsoft.Rest.Azure.CloudException: The provided location 'brazilsoutheast' is not available for resource type 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts'.
