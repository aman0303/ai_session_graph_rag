Security Groups that are added to User Roles must be onboarded to dSTS. See [here][AccessControl] for instructions on how to do this. If after adding the Security Group you are still unable to access your logs due to the same permission check to make sure that your Security Group membership is reflected in your dSTS security token. You can inspect the contents of your token by visiting [TokenDiagnostics][TokenDiagnostics]. \n> 4. If your token does not contain the Security Group, you should contact [dSTS Support][dSTSSupport] for support.  \n> Please see [this][SG] docs. for more info. on Security Groups\n\n> [!TIP]  \n> If you want to provide admin access to a SG, then update SG in *MdsAccountAdmin_&lt;AccountName&gt;* User Role  \n\nIf you don't find your security group, visit [idweb/][idweb] and create a Redmond local domain security group (**not Universal**). Or you can use [MyAccess][MyAccess] security groups. Get an existing admin in your account to add you as part of this group.  \n\nFOR *ME based access and Security groups, please use https://aka.ms/jarvis-dsts or https://aka.ms/microsoftgeneva-dsts portal link and log on with your *ME credentials.

To use the tool, navigate to [Jarvis -> Account -> Logs Account Settings][LogsAccount] -> Authenticate and select your **Endpoint** -> **Tools & References** section as shown below and click **Do I have Permissions on ...** link. \n\n![Permissions Checker][PermissionsCheckerImage]\n\nPlease enter the name of the event/runner/configuration under _Search Pattern_ in the form of regex **^NamespaceEventname.*** to avoid timeout error or to retrieve the fast results of that specific event and click **Check**. \n\n![Permissions Checker][PermissionsCheckerImage2]\n\nOnce the search completes, you can click on the **Access Details** link against the raw resource (event/runner/config.) names and look through the user roles that all have access to the resource. Note that the user role that starts with \"MdsAccountAdmin_\" is the user role that has administrator access to your Logs account. Members of this user role can grant access to other user roles, by either adding you explicitly to an user role in the list or by adding a Security Group that you and others with similar access needs are part of. Your account administrator can use the **User Roles** section of this page to [manage role memberships](tshoot.md#editing-account-settings-and-admin-operations). Alternatively, you can also add yourself to any existing Security Group that is already associated with one of the User Roles.\n\n### I get a \"User has access to none of the specified tables.
