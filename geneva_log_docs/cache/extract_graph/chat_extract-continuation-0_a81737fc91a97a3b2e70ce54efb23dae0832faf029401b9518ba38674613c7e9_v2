Why hasn't my query performance improved?\nThe index is only used for logs uploaded after selective indexing was enabled. If you enabled selective indexing one hour ago and are searching for data for the last 24 hours, we still do a brute force search for 23 of those hours. The query performance should improve as time passes, until all your data is indexed.\n\n##  How does the Kusto ingestion latency impact data availability in DGrep?\nIf you issue a query that uses the index, DGrep will only search data that has already been indexed in Kusto. The Kusto ingestion latency SLA can be found [here](https://kusto.azurewebsites.net/docs/ops/SLA.html).\n\n##  How does the Kusto retention policy impact data availability in DGrep?\nDGrep retrieves the index retention policy from Kusto at query time to determine whether the query can use the index. For example, if the query looks at the past 5 days and the index retention policy is 3 days, DGrep does a brute force search on the first 2 days of the query's time window.\n\n##  Does selective indexing work on fields of any type?\nYes, Selective indexing can enabled on fields of any type.\n\n##  Is selective indexing available in the sovereign clouds?\nSelective indexing will be available in the sovereign clouds soon.\n\n##  Can I enable selective indexing on a derived event?\nEnabling selective indexing on derived events is not currently supported through Jarvis UI. However, you can still enable it by modifying your namespace configuration [manually](../Howtoguides/DGrep/Selectiveindexing/configuremanually.md).\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SELECTIVE INDEXING<|>EVENT<|>Selective indexing is a feature that allows for improved query performance by indexing logs uploaded after it is enabled, thus optimizing search operations over time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUSTO<|>SERVICE<|>Kusto is a data analytics service that provides capabilities for querying and managing large datasets, often used in conjunction with DGrep for log analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREP<|>SERVICE<|>DGrep is a tool that retrieves and analyzes log data, utilizing indexing features from Kusto to enhance query performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUSTO INGESTION LATENCY<|>PARAMETER<|>Kusto ingestion latency refers to the delay between data being ingested into Kusto and its availability for querying, impacting data accessibility in DGrep.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUSTO RETENTION POLICY<|>PARAMETER<|>The Kusto retention policy defines the duration for which data is retained in Kusto, affecting the availability of indexed data for queries in DGrep.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMESPACE CONFIGURATION<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Namespace configuration involves settings that determine how selective indexing and other features are applied to log data.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SELECTIVE INDEXING<|>DGREP<|>Selective indexing enhances the performance of queries issued by DGrep by allowing it to utilize indexed data for improved search efficiency.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUSTO<|>DGREP<|>DGrep relies on Kusto for querying and managing log data, utilizing its indexing capabilities for better performance.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUSTO INGESTION LATENCY<|>DGREP<|>Kusto ingestion latency affects the availability of data in DGrep, as it determines when ingested data can be queried.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUSTO RETENTION POLICY<|>DGREP<|>The Kusto retention policy impacts DGrep's ability to access data based on how long data is retained in Kusto before being purged.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SELECTIVE INDEXING<|>KUSTO<|>Selective indexing is a feature that operates within Kusto to optimize the indexing of log data for improved query performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAMESPACE CONFIGURATION<|>SELECTIVE INDEXING<|>Namespace configuration settings determine how selective indexing is applied to log data, affecting its functionality.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
