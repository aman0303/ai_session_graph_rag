Can you define a derived event that uses multiple event streams as the source? In other words, can you do a JOIN of multiple tables in a derived event?**\n\n\n\nYes, use the VAR clause in your query to union data and JOIN to join it.\n\n\n\n**Q. How are the Partition Key (PK) and Row Key (RK) determined for a derived event?**\n\n\n\nIf a derived event is run centrally, then currently the default PK and RK are assigned as follows:  \n1. the PK is always the start time stamp of the query interval  \n2. if the derived event has no groupby, then the RK is inherited from the source. Otherwise, the RK is  \nthe concatenation of the groupby columns.  \nYou can override the default PK and RK, but you must override both of them.\n\n\n\n\\*\\* Pk/Rk is a table only (storeType=\"Central\") concept. CentralBond is a blob storage format.\n\n\n\n**Q. Are there limitations around the size of Partition Key and Row Key values****?**\n\n\n\nYes, if you are using storeType=\"Central\" and your PK or RK is longer than 512 characters, there may exceptions writing results to XStore. This is typically an issue when several groupby columns are used. To work around these limitations, you can override the RK with a deterministic hash. An example of how to do this in your query is shown below.\n\n\n\n    \n    groupby Column1, Column2, Column3\n    let PkTemp= FixedLengthString(BeginOfQueryInterval())\n    let RkTemp = CreateDeterministicGuid(Concat(\"___\", Column1, Column2, Column3))\n    let PartitionKey = PkTemp\n    let RowKey = RkTemp\n\n\n\n**Q. How do mapping monikers affect centrally derived events?**\n\n\n\nYou can optionally use Mapping monikers in the <Account> section of your config to distribute MA uploaded data between multiple storage accounts. When the source of your derived event is generated by MA and mapping monikers are used, your centrally derived event will run separate queries to process data from each of your storage accounts. The derived event will then write each set of results to your default storage account. For example, the below mapping would cause a central derived event to run 3 independent queries (1 for each storage account) and to write the result to the default storage account, \"MyMonikerGroupUSWest\".\n\n\n\n    \n    &lt;Account moniker=\"MyMonikerGroup\" isDefault=\"true\"&gt;\n        &lt;Mapping moniker=\"MyMonikerGroupUSWest\" isDefault=\"true\" /&gt;\n        &lt;Mapping moniker=\"MyMonikerGroupUSEast\" /&gt;\n        &lt;Mapping moniker=\"MyMonikerGroupUSCentral\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/Account&gt;\n\n\n\n**Q. How many rows can a single central derived event instance query?**\n\n\n\nA single derived event instance can query up to 20 million rows. Derived events attempting to query more than 20 million rows will experience data loss. When the source table of a central derived event uses mapping monikers, a separate derived event instance will be run for each mapping moniker.\n\n\n\n**Q. When using groupby in a query, how many rows can be in a single group?**\n\n\n\nA single group can contain no more than 300k rows. If any group contains more rows than 300k rows, the derived event will fail without producing any result.\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>EVENT<|>A derived event is a type of event that is generated from multiple event streams, allowing for complex queries and data manipulation, including the use of JOIN operations on multiple tables.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAR CLAUSE<|>COMMAND<|>The VAR clause is a command used in queries to define variables that can be used to union data from multiple sources in derived events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARTITION KEY<|>PARAMETER<|>The Partition Key (PK) is a parameter that determines how data is partitioned in storage, specifically for derived events, and is assigned based on the start time stamp of the query interval.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROW KEY<|>PARAMETER<|>The Row Key (RK) is a parameter that uniquely identifies a row within a partition and can be inherited from the source or defined by concatenating groupby columns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORETYPE<|>PARAMETER<|>StoreType is a parameter that defines the storage format for derived events, with \"Central\" indicating a specific blob storage format.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPPING MONIKERS<|>PARAMETER<|>Mapping monikers are parameters used in configuration to distribute data uploaded by monitoring agents across multiple storage accounts for derived events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL DERIVED EVENT<|>EVENT<|>A central derived event is an event that is processed centrally, allowing for the querying of large datasets and the application of mapping monikers for data distribution.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUERY<|>QUERY<|>A query is a command used to retrieve and manipulate data from event streams, including the use of groupby and other operations to filter and aggregate data.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>VAR CLAUSE<|>The derived event can utilize the VAR clause to union data from multiple event streams, enabling complex data queries.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>PARTITION KEY<|>The Partition Key is essential for defining how derived events are stored and accessed, particularly in a central context.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>ROW KEY<|>The Row Key is used in conjunction with the Partition Key to uniquely identify rows in derived events, affecting data retrieval.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>CENTRAL DERIVED EVENT<|>A derived event can be processed as a central derived event, which allows for querying large datasets and applying specific storage formats.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRAL DERIVED EVENT<|>STORETYPE<|>The storeType parameter defines the storage format for central derived events, impacting how data is stored and accessed.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRAL DERIVED EVENT<|>MAPPING MONIKERS<|>Mapping monikers can be used in central derived events to manage data distribution across multiple storage accounts, enhancing data organization.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUERY<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>Queries are used to define the logic and parameters for derived events, including the use of groupby and other operations.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
