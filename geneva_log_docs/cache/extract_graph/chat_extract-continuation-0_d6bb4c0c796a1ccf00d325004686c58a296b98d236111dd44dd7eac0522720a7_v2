Geneva LogsToMetrics service exposes the following metrics to help with capacity monitoring, under `LogsToMetricsQos` MDM Namespace in your MDM Account.  \n\n    `CapacityUtilization`: Capacity used by your namespace.  \n    `Quota`: Pre allocated quota for your namespace.  \n    `CapacityUtilizationPerRule`: Capacity used by a single rule in your namespace.  \n    `QuotaPerRule`: Pre allocated quota for a single rule in your namespace.  \n\n1. In Jarvis UI, go to page Manage->Metrics->Monitor. Fill in your MDM Account, Namespace: LogsToMetricsQoS, Metric: CapacityUtilization. Click Add to create a monitor.\n\n1. Edit and customize the monitor, \n    1. Data Source section:  \n        Pre-aggreggate: MdsEndpoint/EventNamespace  \n        Dimension filters: Enter values for MdsEndpoint and EventNamespace  \n\n    1. Alerting Logic section:  \n        Use percentage template.  \n        In the numerator, pick sampling type `Sum` from the chosen `CapacityUtilization` metric.  \n        In the denominator, **click change metric and select `Quota` metric**, use sampling type `Sum`.  \n        Then, fill out the alert condition as you desire.\n\n    1. Health model section:  \n        Pick an existing resource type or follow the below instructions to create a new resource type. This section instructs how geneva health system renders the resource being monitored and where IcM should route the incident for your team.\n        1. Click Add resource Type and give it a name.\n        1. Identifying dimensions should have MdsEndpoint and EventNamespace to match the metric being alerted on.\n        1. Select an appropriate incident routing id for your team\n        1. On the Health tree visualization page, give the resource a name. Then, add child levels for MdsEndpoint and EventNamespace. Here is an example:\n        ![Health Tree](../images/ltm_capacityalert_healthtree.png)\n\n1. Hit Save to save the monitor.\n\n1. Now, we have created an alert for monitoring LTM capacity utilization at a namespace level.\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>SERVICE<|>LogsToMetrics is a service that provides metrics for monitoring capacity utilization in a namespace, helping to prevent throttling of data by managing capacity effectively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICSQOS<|>NAMESPACE<|>LogsToMetricsQoS is an MDM Namespace that contains metrics related to capacity utilization for the LogsToMetrics service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPACITYUTILIZATION<|>PARAMETER<|>CapacityUtilization is a metric that indicates the amount of capacity used by a namespace, essential for monitoring and managing resource allocation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUOTA<|>PARAMETER<|>Quota is a pre-allocated limit of capacity for a namespace, which helps in managing resource usage and preventing throttling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPACITYUTILIZATIONPERRULE<|>PARAMETER<|>CapacityUtilizationPerRule is a metric that shows the capacity used by a single rule within a namespace, allowing for more granular monitoring.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUOTAPERULE<|>PARAMETER<|>QuotaPerRule is a pre-allocated limit of capacity for a single rule in a namespace, helping to manage resource allocation effectively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARVIS UI<|>SERVICE<|>Jarvis UI is a user interface that allows users to manage metrics and monitors for capacity utilization in their MDM Account.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALERTING LOGIC<|>PARAMETER<|>Alerting Logic is a section in the monitor setup that defines the conditions under which alerts are triggered based on metrics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTH MODEL<|>PARAMETER<|>Health Model is a section that instructs how the Geneva health system renders the resource being monitored and routes incidents accordingly.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>LOGSTOMETRICSQOS<|>LogsToMetrics service exposes metrics under the LogsToMetricsQoS namespace for monitoring capacity utilization.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICSQOS<|>CAPACITYUTILIZATION<|>CapacityUtilization is a key metric provided under the LogsToMetricsQoS namespace for monitoring capacity usage.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICSQOS<|>QUOTA<|>Quota is another important metric under the LogsToMetricsQoS namespace that helps manage capacity limits.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICSQOS<|>CAPACITYUTILIZATIONPERRULE<|>CapacityUtilizationPerRule provides insights into the capacity used by individual rules within the LogsToMetricsQoS namespace.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICSQOS<|>QUOTAPERULE<|>QuotaPerRule is a metric that helps manage the capacity limits for individual rules in the LogsToMetricsQoS namespace.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JARVIS UI<|>LOGSTOMETRICS<|>Jarvis UI is used to create and manage monitors for the LogsToMetrics service, facilitating capacity monitoring.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JARVIS UI<|>ALERTING LOGIC<|>The Alerting Logic section in Jarvis UI is where users define conditions for alerts based on metrics.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JARVIS UI<|>HEALTH MODEL<|>The Health Model section in Jarvis UI provides instructions on how to visualize and manage the health of monitored resources.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
