All of the information MA needs to use the service is passed to it through either MonAgentHost.exe or MonAgentLauncher.exe arguments.\n\n### Supported Agent Versions\nYou should redeploy your full MA to the latest version to use GCS for the first time (i.e. migrating from full keys or autokey).\n\n### Linux Agent User (mdsd)\nThe instructions below are for configuring the Windows MA. See [this](~/getting_started/environments/linuxvm.md) help page for more details on how to configure the Linux MA (mdsd).\n\n### Migration from AutoKey or Storage Keys\nWhen you use GCS, you no longer directly provide MA with storage key or AutoKey bootstrap SAS keys in your deployment. In your pre-migration MA environment, you passed MA a connection string via the -XstoreAccounts option to MonAgentHost.exe or the MONITORING_XSTORE_ACCOUNTS environment variable or the Azure Configuration variable MonitoringXStoreAccounts to MonAgentLauncher.exe. After migrating you no longer pass MA connection strings via these parameters. Instead, you provide MA with the information described in this document.\n\nIn addition, you no longer have to specify autoKey=\"true\" in your account section of your configuration file. You should still specify this, however, until all of your MA instances are fully migrated to GCS, so that both MA's locally configured with auto-key connection strings and GCS info will function properly. You can on-board to GCS and use autoKey simultaneously in different MA instances.\n\nAs discussed, Geneva takes over responsibility for properly managing your account information.\n\nSee the [Tips and tricks](#tips-and-tricks) section below for more information on migration to GCS for older namespace and configurations.\n\n### Connection and Service Identities\n- __Connection information__ - This includes the GCS endpoint name and the certificate thumbprint and store, so that MA can communicate with GCS and authenticate with the private key certificate installed on the system. The possible endpoints you can use are the following.\n    - gcs.ppe.monitoring.core.windows.net (formerly ppe.warmpath.msftcloudes.com) (If the Geneva environment where your configs exist is - Test, Stage)\n    - gcs.prod.monitoring.core.windows.net (formerly prod.warmpath.msftcloudes.com) (If the Geneva environment where your configs exist is - DiagnosticsProd, FirstPartyProd, BillingProd, ExternalProd)\n    - mooncake.warmpath.chinacloudapi.cn  (If the Geneva environment where your configs exist is -  CaMoonCake)\n    - gcs.monitoring.core.usgovcloudapi.net (formerly fairfax.warmpath.usgovcloudapi.net) (If the Geneva environment where your configs exist is -  CaFairFax)\n    - gcs.monitoring.core.eaglex.ic.gov (USNat)\n    - gcs.monitoring.core.microsoft.scloud (USSec)\n\n>[!NOTE] \n> Providing MA with the endpoint is optional and not recommended. MA automatically determines the endpoint from the service identity environment. For national clouds you need to specify the endpoint using MONITORING_GCS_ENDPOINT environment variable or GcsEndpoint Azure configuration setting, if you are using a MA version below 37.2.\n\n- DSMS\n    - See [here][dSMSCerts] for information on using dSMS managed certificates with Geneva. You can then configure MA as shown in the following sections to use DSMS on the node hosting MA.\n- Azure Key Vault\n    - ​Now you can use Keyvault managed certificate in Geneva Logs by configuring the GCS as [described here][AKVCerts] and changing the -connectionInfo argument of MA launch script. MA requires the SAN of the AKV certificate which you intend to use. Using the SAN MA would lookup the certificate in LOCAL_MACHINE\\MY and MY stores and upon successful retrieval would use it to authenticate with GCS.\n\n- __Service identity__ - This includes the Geneva environment, account, and configuration namespace information. It also, includes the region that MA is running in. The possible environments include the following and map to the different Geneva service environments we maintain and you onboard to using the management UI and API's.\n    - Test\n    - Stage\n    - DiagnosticsProd\n    - FirstPartyProd\n    - BillingProd\n    - ExternalProd\n    - CaMoonCake\n    - CaBlackForest\n    - CaFairFax\n    - USNat\n    - USSec\n\n- __Configuration Version__ - The configuration version you specify is the version that MA will request and download from the GCS service and use to collect data. In Geneva versions are immutable, so MA will continue to use the version you specify even if you create new versions in our central Geneva/Jarvis service. If you use Agent Explorer to dynamically update your config version, then MA uses whatever version is greatest; either the version specified on your node when you start MA or the version you updated too.\n    - Please see the [Configuration Deployment] section to know more on how to get the configuration version.\n    - Specifying the config version is optional, *but highly recommended*. Instead of using the -configVersion option, you can use the connection and service identity parameters to enable GCS based storage key management, but still pass MA your deployed configuration file with the -configFile option. More information later in this help page.\n    - See the [safe deployment practices](MigrateToGCS.md#safe-deployment-practices-sdp) section in this document for information on what happens if you specify a version that\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YOURNAMESPACE<|>NAMESPACE<|>YourNamespace is a placeholder representing a specific namespace used in the context of configuration and deployment, not an actual configuration ID.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MA INSTANCES<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>MA instances refer to the Monitoring Agent instances that are deployed to collect and manage monitoring data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCS<|>SERVICE<|>GCS (Geneva Cloud Service) is a service that facilitates the management of monitoring agents and their configurations without requiring changes to the agent configuration files.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONAGENTHOST.EXE<|>COMMAND<|>MonAgentHost.exe is a command-line tool that runs the Monitoring Agent and accepts various arguments for configuration and operation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONAGENTLAUNCHER.EXE<|>COMMAND<|>MonAgentLauncher.exe is a command-line tool that launches the Monitoring Agent with specified parameters and configurations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX MA<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>Linux MA (mdsd) refers to the version of the Monitoring Agent that runs on Linux systems, with specific configuration instructions provided.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOKEY<|>PARAMETER<|>AutoKey is a parameter that was previously used to manage access keys for the Monitoring Agent but is being phased out in favor of GCS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE KEYS<|>PARAMETER<|>Storage keys are credentials used to access storage accounts, which are no longer directly provided to the Monitoring Agent when using GCS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONNECTION STRING<|>CONNECTION STRING<|>A connection string is a string that contains information needed to establish a connection to a service or database, previously used by the Monitoring Agent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE IDENTITY<|>PARAMETER<|>Service identity includes the Geneva environment, account, and configuration namespace information necessary for the Monitoring Agent to operate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFIGURATION VERSION<|>PARAMETER<|>Configuration version is the specific version of the configuration that the Monitoring Agent requests and uses to collect data from the GCS service.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MA INSTANCES<|>GCS<|>MA instances are configured to use the GCS service for management and operation without requiring changes to their configuration files.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONAGENTHOST.EXE<|>MA INSTANCES<|>MonAgentHost.exe is used to run and manage MA instances, providing necessary arguments for their operation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONAGENTLAUNCHER.EXE<|>MA INSTANCES<|>MonAgentLauncher.exe is responsible for launching MA instances with the required configurations and parameters.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX MA<|>MA INSTANCES<|>Linux MA (mdsd) is a specific type of MA instance that requires different configuration instructions compared to Windows MA.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOKEY<|>STORAGE KEYS<|>AutoKey was previously used to manage access to storage keys, which are now being phased out with the introduction of GCS.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONNECTION STRING<|>MA INSTANCES<|>Connection strings were previously provided to MA instances for accessing storage accounts, but this method has changed with GCS.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICE IDENTITY<|>MA INSTANCES<|>Service identity provides the necessary context for MA instances to operate within the Geneva environment and access configurations.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONFIGURATION VERSION<|>MA INSTANCES<|>Configuration version is requested by MA instances to ensure they are using the correct settings for data collection.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
