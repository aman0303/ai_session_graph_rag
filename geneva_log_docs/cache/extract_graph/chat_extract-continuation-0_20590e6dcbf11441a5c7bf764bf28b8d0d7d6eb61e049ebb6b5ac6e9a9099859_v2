Go to [Manage->Connectors->Logs to metrics](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/?page=settings&mode=connectors&tab=dgrep)\n2. Select an *endpoint*.\n3. Select a Geneva Logs *namespace* containing your LTM rules.\n4. Click on **Rule Health** link for a rule whose health you want to observe.\n\n## *Usage* section\n\nThe *Usage* section of the dashboard shows the following charts:\n\n1. **Processed blobs/s** : The number of blobs processed per second by the LogsToMetrics connector service for each Geneva Logs namespace.\n2. **Processed bytes/s** : The number of bytes processed per second by the LogsToMetrics connector service for each Geneva Logs namespace.\n3. **Consumed computation units/s** : The number of computation units consumed per second by each LogsToMetrics rule. A computation unit is equivalent to a millisecond of CPU time.\n4. **Published metrics/s** : The number of metrics published to Geneva Metrics service per second by each LogsToMetrics rule.\n\n## *Throttling* section\n\nThe *Throttling* section of the dashboard shows the following charts:\n\n1. **Throttled blobs/s** : The number of blobs throttled per second by the LogsToMetrics connector service for each Geneva Logs namespace.\n2. **Throttled bytes/s** : The number of bytes throttled per second by the LogsToMetrics connector service for each Geneva Logs namespace.\n3. **Throttled computation units/s** : The estimated number of computation units throttled per second for each LogsToMetrics rule. A computation unit is equivalent to a millisecond of CPU time.\n4. **Throttled metrics/s** : The estimated number of metrics throttled per second for each LogsToMetrics rule.\n\nSee [Limits and Quotas](./quota.md), for more details about throttling.\n\n## *Latency* section\n\nThe *Latency* section of the dashboard shows the following charts:\n\n1. **Rule processing time** : Time spent running a rule against the contents of a blob. This is a product of the average blob size and the rule's computational complexity.\n2. **Blob processing time** : Time spent processing each blob. This includes the time spent downloading the blob from storage and the rule processing time.\n3. **Geneva latency per blob** : Time elapsed from the moment a blob is uploaded to Geneva until the corresponding metrics are published to Geneva Metrics. This includes the blob processing time and queueing time.\n4. **End-to-end metric latency** : Average time spent from the moment a log event is emitted from your service until the corresponding metrics are published to Geneva Metrics. This includes the Geneva latency per blob and the blob upload period.\n\n>[!Note]  \n>This metric relies on the timestamp contained in the log event, so it is only as accurate as the timestamps provided by your service.  \n>\n## *Processing failures* section\n\nThe *Processing failures* section shows the following charts:\n(Note, please, see our [troubleshooting documentation](../../Troubleshooting/L2Mtroubleshooting.md) for help fixing some of these errors).\n\n1. **Metric publishing failures** : The number of metrics that failed to be emitted, along with a status code. These are the possible status codes:\n   * *OldMetric*: The metric timestamp is more than 20 minutes in the past.\n   * *FutureMetric*: The metric timestamp is more than 5 minutes in the future.\n   * *NullDimension*: A dimension value was null or empty.\n   * *LongDimension*: A dimension value length is greater than the maximum allowed (1024 characters).\n   * *NegativeMetricValue*: The metric value was negative.\n   * *MetricValueOverflow*: The metric value is greater than the maximum allowed (Int64.MaxValue).\n2. **Rule processing failures** : The number of failures while trying to apply a rule to a blob, along with a status code. These are the possible status codes:\n     * *ParsingError*: There was an error parsing the rule.\n     * *PropertyNotPresent*: A property specified in the rule does not exist in the blob.\n     * *NoTimePropertyDefined*: The rule output contains no timestamp column (please, see our [documentation](gettingstarted.md) about defining rules).\n     * *NoMetricDefined*: The rule output contains no metric column (please, see our [documentation](gettingstarted.md) about defining rules).\n3. **Blob processing failures** : The number of failures while trying to process a blob. These errors should be rare and usually indicate an issue deserializing the blob. If you see these errors and are unsure about the cause, please, contact [Geneva Support](https://aka.ms/genevasupport).\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
