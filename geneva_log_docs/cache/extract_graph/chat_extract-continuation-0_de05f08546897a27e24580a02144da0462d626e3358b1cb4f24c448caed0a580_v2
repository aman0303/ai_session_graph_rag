12/06/2024\n---\n\n# Migrating from the original Extensibility SDK\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This information applies to the .NET Standard Extensibility SDK `Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk`.\n> For more information, see [Extensibility SDK Overview](./intro.md).\n\nIf you are migrating from the previous version of the SDK, [Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DataPipe.EventStreamExtension](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_artifacts/feed/Official/NuGet/Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DataPipe.EventStreamExtension), \nto the new version of the SDK, [Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_artifacts/feed/Official/NuGet/Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk),\nthere are some additional considerations.\n\nThe previous SDK uses [Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor.EventProcessorHost](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.eventhubs.processor.eventprocessorhost) to process Event Hubs messages.\nThe new SDK uses the [Azure Event Hubs Event Processor client library for .NET - Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/messaging.eventhubs.processor-readme).\nThe Azure Event Hubs client library introduces breaking changes regarding how checkpoint blobs are stored in storage account containers.\nFor details, see [Guide for migrating to Azure.Messaging.EventHubs from Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/MigrationGuide.md#migrating-eventprocessorhost-checkpoints) \nand [Migrating EventProcessorHost checkpoints](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/MigrationGuide.md#migrating-eventprocessorhost-checkpoints).\n\nIn short, the new SDK will not use the Event Hubs checkpoints from the previous SDK.\nThe new SDK will start processing Event Hubs messages from scratch.\n\nThe following sections describe a few options when migrating.\n\n# Option 1: do nothing\n\nIf you switch from the previous SDK to the new SDK without migrating, the new SDK starts processing Event Hubs messages at the `timeToLookBackIfNoCheckpoint`, which is 1 hour by default.\nFor example, if the new SDK starts up well within 1 hour of when the previous SDK stopped, some events may be re-processed, and no events should be dropped.\nHowever, if the new SDK starts up after 1 hour of when the previous SDK stopped, events will be skipped.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Like usual, your `ProcessBatchAsync` method must be tolerant of receiving the same event to be processed more than once.\n> For details, see [Using the Extensibility SDK - EventStreamBase](./usage.md#eventstreambase).\n\n# Option 2: set the timeToLookBackIfNoCheckpoint\n\nYou can set the `timeToLookBackIfNoCheckpoint` to ensure the new SDK starts processing Event Hubs messages before the previous SDK stopped.\nThe minimum value is zero, and the maximum value is 1 day.\n\n## timeToLookBackIfNoCheckpoint sample\n\nThis example shows how to set the `timeToLookBackIfNoCheckpoint`.\nFor more samples, see [Using the Extensibility SDK](usage.md).\n\n```cs\nvar eventHubDetails = new EventHubDetails(\n    \"myConsumerGroup\",\n    BrokerKind.Scrubbed,\n    timeToLookBackIfNoCheckpoint: TimeSpan.FromDays(1));\n...\nusing var processor = new EventStreamProcessor(\n    genevaAccountDetails,\n    eventFilters,\n    eventHubDetails,\n    eventStreamBase,\n    telemetryDetails);\n```\n\n# Option 3: migrate checkpoints\n\nYou can configure migration to migrate Event Hub checkpoints.\nThe SDK will automatically migrate `EventProcessorHost` checkpoints from the previous SDK to `EventProcessorClient` checkpoints for the new SDK.\nThen the new SDK will start where the previous SDK stopped.\n\nSome details:\n\n- Migration is optional and will only be performed if the `MigrationDetails` are specified.\n\n- Migration occurs once per moniker Event Hub and consumer group during `EventStreamProcessor` startup.\n\n- If migration fails, errors will be logged, and SDK processing will be blocked.\n  Migration is idempotent and will be retried but must succeed to continue.\n\n- If migration has already completed successfully, startup incurs a small performance overhead to check whether migration has already occurred.\n\n  > [!IMPORTANT]\n  > Some time after migration is complete, you should remove the `MigrationDetails` so that the migration check will not occur.\n\n- Migration is only supported moving forward.\n  Event Hubs checkpoints cannot be migrated from the new SDK back to the previous SDK.\n\n- If needed, checkpoints can be re-migrated.\n  To do so, stop all processors, call `EventStreamProcessor.ClearEventHubsCheckpointsAsync`, and restart processors.\n\n## MigrationDetails\n\nThis class contains the details of how to migrate checkpoints.\n\nThe parameters are:\n\n- `checkpointStorageAccountUri`: The URI of the checkpoint storage account for the previous SDK.\n\n  > [!NOTE]\n  > You no longer specify the checkpoint storage account for the new SDK.\n  > The SDK will automatically use a checkpoint storage\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EXTENSIBILITY SDK<|>SERVICE<|>The Extensibility SDK is a software development kit that
