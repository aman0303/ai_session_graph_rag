Since DGrep distributes work among many nodes, queries tend to be a lot faster than single machine searches done by [MdsDataAccessClient](../../../consume/logs/mdac/setup.md).\n\n## DGrep SDK package\n\nDGrep SDK is available as a nuget package `Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DGrep.SDK` in \"Official\" package store.\n\nYou could connect to the feed and install the package by executing these commands:\n\n```powershell\nnuget.exe sources Add -Name \"Official\" -Source \"https://msazure.pkgs.visualstudio.com/One/_packaging/OneBranch-Consumption/nuget/v3/index.json\"\nInstall-Package Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DGrep.SDK\n```\n\n> [!Important]\n> Existing customers of DGrep SDK via MDS-DataAccessClient package - Please note that MDS-DataAccessClient is now deprecated and is no longer supported.\n\n### Moving from MDS-DataAccessClient to Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DGrep.SDK\nIf you are a current user of `MDS-DataAccessClient` package and need the latest official DGrep SDK, please move to `Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DGrep.SDK` by following 3 simple steps.\nThe public API surface has not changed since `MDS-DataAccessClient v78.0.0.18`. It should be a non-breaking change in most cases, unless you are on a really old version of `MDS-DataAccessClient`.\n\n1. Remove `MDS-DataAccessClient` package dependency\n1. Add `Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DGrep.SDK` package and its dependencies\n1. Replace all usages of `using Microsoft.Cis.Monitoring.DataAccess.DGrep;` with `using Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DGrep.SDK;`\n\n\n## Use cases and recommendations\n\n1. You run one query at a time and execute them on-demand (i.e., interactively). This scenario is best served by `DGrepUserAuthClient` that comes with DGrep SDK. This client requires 2FA and has a limit of 1 query at a time. This is the quickest way to get started.\n\n1. Your queries need to run in parallel or are executed automatically on a scheduled basis and the expected number of queries per day it at most a few hundred. This scenario is best served by `DGrepClient` that comes with DGrep SDK. This client requires certificate authentication and has a limit of 5 concurrent queries. Please read the [authentication](#authentication) section.\n\n1. For more data intensive scenarios (such as active monitoring) or other scenarios not covered by the DGrep SDK, we recommend the [Extensibility SDK](../ExtensibilitySDK/intro.md).\n\n## Authentication\n\n1. **User based authentication:** \n   \n   If you plan to use user based authentication, no onboarding is required other than making sure that your corp account has access to the desired event (you can validate this by executing a DGrep query in the UI).\n\n1. **Certificate based authentication:**\n\n    If you plan to use certificate based authentication: \n\n    * please follow [these steps](../../../collect/authentication/keyvaultcreatecert.md) to create an Key Vault certificate issued by OneCert or [these](../../../collect/authentication/dsms.md) for a dSMS Managed certificate.\n    * DGrep supports automatically authorizing the AKV/DSMS certs for any User roles with “read” permission.\n    * In case you already don’t have a user role, create a new **User role with read permission** and add/create the AKV/DSMS cert to it. Now this cert should be authorized to query data via DGrep SDK. [Here are the detailed steps](../../../collect/authentication/keyvaultlogsauthorize.md) to add a managed certificate to Geneva Logs account.\n\n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    > DGrep accepts only OneCert certificates from Azure KeyVault or trusted certificates from dSMS.\n\n## DGrep Endpoints\n\nDGrep SDK requires users to provide an [MDS Endpoint](../../Resources/endpoints.md#environments-to-onboard-to) and DGrep endpoint address. Below are a list of DGrep endpoints.\n\n\n1. Public cloud: https://dgrepv2-frontend-prod.trafficmanager.net\n1. Mooncake: https://dgrepv2-frontend-prod.trafficmanager.cn\n1. Fairfax: https://dgrepv2-frontend-prod.usgovtrafficmanager.net\n1. USSec: https://dgrepv2-frontend-prod.trafficmanager.microsoft.scloud\n1. USNat: https://dgrepv2-frontend-prod.trafficmanager.eaglex.ic.gov\n\n## Quotas\n\nDGrep is a shared service and it needs to ensure that no single client can exhaust all of its resources. In order to guarantee this, DGrep has an upper limit on the number of outstanding queries per client (more specifically, per client certificate thumbprint). When a client’s quota is exhausted, an attempt to start a new query will fail with `HTTP status 503`.\n\nQueries initiated by the `DGrepClient.RunQueryAsync` or `DGrepClient.StartQueryAsync` methods are considered outstanding until the `IDGrepQuery.CloseAsync` method is called. Queries initiated by `DGrepClient.GetRowSetResultAsync` or `DGrepClient.GetCsvResultAsync` are automatically closed before the task returned by those methods completes. If a query is not closed by the client (for example, if the application crashes), the query is automatically closed between 60 and 90 seconds after the last request received from the client.\n\n*\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DGREP SDK<|>SERVICE<|>DGrep SDK allows users to search their logs programmatically using the same infrastructure that powers the DGrep log search UI, distributing work among many nodes for faster queries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT.AZURE.MONITORING.DGREP.SDK<|>PACKAGE<|>Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DGrep.SDK is a nuget package available in the Official package store for integrating DGrep SDK functionalities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MDS DATAACCESSCLIENT<|>PACKAGE<|>MDS-DataAccessClient is a deprecated package that was previously used for accessing DGrep functionalities but is no longer supported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREPUSERAUTHCLIENT<|>CLIENT<|>DGrepUserAuthClient is a client that comes with DGrep SDK, designed for running one query at a time interactively, requiring 2FA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREPCLIENT<|>CLIENT<|>DGrepClient is a client that allows running multiple queries in parallel, requiring certificate authentication and supporting up to 5 concurrent queries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTENSIBILITY SDK<|>SERVICE<|>The Extensibility SDK is recommended for more data-intensive scenarios or other use cases not covered by the DGrep SDK.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER BASED AUTHENTICATION<|>AUTHENTICATION<|>User based authentication allows users to access DGrep functionalities without onboarding, provided they have the necessary permissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFICATE BASED AUTHENTICATION<|>AUTHENTICATION<|>Certificate based authentication requires users to create a Key Vault certificate and authorize it for querying data via DGrep SDK.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MDS ENDPOINT<|>ENDPOINT<|>MDS Endpoint is required for users to provide the DGrep endpoint address for accessing DGrep services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREP ENDPOINTS<|>ENDPOINT<|>DGrep endpoints are specific URLs for accessing DGrep services in different environments, including public cloud and various regional clouds.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUOTAS<|>PARAMETER<|>Quotas are limits set by DGrep to ensure fair resource usage among clients, preventing any single client from exhausting resources.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP SDK<|>MICROSOFT.AZURE.MONITORING.DGREP.SDK<|>DGrep SDK is implemented through the Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DGrep.SDK package for programmatic log searching.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MDS DATAACCESSCLIENT<|>MICROSOFT.AZURE.MONITORING.DGREP.SDK<|>MDS-DataAccessClient is deprecated in favor of the Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DGrep.SDK package for accessing DGrep functionalities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREPUSERAUTHCLIENT<|>DGREP SDK<|>DGrepUserAuthClient is a component of the DGrep SDK designed for interactive query execution.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREPCLIENT<|>DGREP SDK<|>DGrepClient is another component of the DGrep SDK that allows for parallel query execution.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTENSIBILITY SDK<|>DGREP SDK<|>The Extensibility SDK is recommended for scenarios that require more advanced functionalities beyond what DGrep SDK offers.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER BASED AUTHENTICATION<|>DGREP SDK<|>User based authentication is a method supported by DGrep SDK for accessing its functionalities without additional onboarding.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CERTIFICATE BASED AUTHENTICATION<|>DGREP SDK<|>Certificate based authentication is a required method for using the DGrepClient for executing multiple queries in parallel.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MDS ENDPOINT<|>DGREP ENDPOINTS<|>MDS Endpoint is necessary for users to connect to the various DGrep endpoints for service access.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUOTAS<|>DGREP SDK<|>Quotas are enforced by DGrep SDK to manage resource allocation and prevent overuse by any single client.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
