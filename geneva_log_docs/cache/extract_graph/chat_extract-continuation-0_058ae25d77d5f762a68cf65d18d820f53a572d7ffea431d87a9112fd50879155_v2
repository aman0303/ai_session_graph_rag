In this document, we will go over the prerequisites, the setup process and usage of LTM GA extension.\n\n## Availability\n\nLTM GA extension is available in the following regions and environments:\n\n| Ev2 Rollout Infra | Geneva Environment | Supported |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Test | Test | Yes |\n| Test | Smoke | Yes |\n| Test | Stage | Yes |\n| Prod | DiagnosticsProd | Yes |\n| Prod | FirstpartyProd | Yes |\n| Prod | BillingProd | Yes |\n| Prod | ExternalProd | Yes |\n| Fairfax | CaFairfax | Yes |\n| Mooncake | CaMooncake | Yes |\n| USSec | USSec | Yes |\n| USNat | USNat | Yes |\n\n## Onboarding\n\n### Prepare an AAD identity that will be used to execute the extension\n\nAuthentication in the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension is based on AAD application backed by a certificate.\nInside the extension, this AAD application will be used to perform RBAC checks against Geneva Logs and Geneva Metrics accounts.\n\nHere are the steps for creating a new AAD application and granting EV2 with access to the certificate, so EV2 can call the extension:\n\n1. Register a unique subject name with OneCert. This domain will be used as the subject name for the certificate in the next steps.\n2. Create a Key Vault (KV) that will store the certificate, and grant EV2 access to the Key Vault. See [EV2 Permissions](https://ev2docs.azure.net/features/security/secrets/permissions.html).\n3. Create a AME-signed certificate in KV with the unique subject name that was registered in OneCert in previous step.\n4. Create an AAD app registration. Refer to [Using AAD app authentication with Geneva Actions](https://eng.ms/docs/products/geneva/actions/howdoi/useaad) for details.\n\n    - Set uniqueName to be some unique string (like `\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \ntenant\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n/\n -- openCurlyBracket -- \nappId\n -- closeCurlyBracket -- \n` or something else)\n    - Include the certificate subject name from step #3 in the ARM manifest under trustedCertificateSubjects.\n    - Assign a claim with scope \"LogsToMetrics\" and role \"PlatformServiceOperator\" by following the steps under [Assign claims to your AAD Service Principal using Powershell cmdlets](https://eng.ms/docs/products/geneva/actions/howdoi/useaad#assign-claims-to-your-aad-service-principal-using-powershell-cmdlets)\n        - This step is required because Geneva Actions blocked the default claim PlatformServiceViewer for security.\n        - Currently there is no way to automate this step, however, based on the doc, the claim assigned in Public environment will be replicated to sovereign clouds, if you are using an AAD app with same unique name.\n\n### Grant the AAD identity with permissions on Logs and Metrics accounts\n\nThe AAD application created in the previous section is used for authenticating and authorizing access to the resources that LTM GA needs - Geneva Logs account/namespace and Geneva Metrics account.\nTherefore, you need to grant sufficient permissions for the AAD application to allow creating and updating LTM rules in these accounts.\n\n- For Geneva Logs Account\n\n    1. Open the [Logs Account Settings](https://portal-int.microsoftgeneva.com/account/logs) page and select the endpoint and account name.\n    2. Click User Roles and find a role with enough permissions on your namespace (needs to be able to update configuration).\n    3. Click the \"Managed Certs/Identities\" link for the role you found on previous step.\n    4. Expand \"Managed Identities\", add the Object ID and Tenant ID of your AAD App and click Save.\n\n- For Geneva Metrics Account\n\n    1. Open the [Metrics Account Settings](https://portal-int.microsoftgeneva.com/account/metrics) page and select the account name.\n    2. Click \"Machine Access\"\n    3. Expand Managed Identities, add the Object ID and Tenant ID, select the ConfigurationEditor role and click Save.\n\n## Using the extension\n\nUse the [following samples](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/Mgmt-Observability-LogsToMetrics?path=/GenevaActions/EV2/Sample&version=GBmain) to configure and use LTM GA extension for your needs.\n\nPlease note that these samples assume that you are using [managed SDP](https://ev2docs.azure.net/getting-started/managed-sdp.html), as \"classic\" EV2 is considered deprecated and should not be used.\nRefer to the [following article](https://ev2docs.azure.net/getting-started/ra-classic-landing.html?q=classic) for more details.\n\n### Configuration files\n\n1. Use `RolloutSpec.json` as a root EV2 file for running the extension.\n2. Modify `ServiceModel.json` with:\n\n    - `serviceIdentifier` - this should be your service-tree ID.\n    - `serviceGroup` - should be changed to reflect your org, see [ServiceGroup naming convention](https://ev2docs.azure.net/features/service-artifacts/serviceModel.html#servicegroup-naming-convention)\n    - `displayName` - change to whatever you like.\n    - All other properties that have `SampleExecuteLogsToMetricsExtension` - change to something that would make sense to your team.\n\n3. Modify `Parameters/RolloutParameters.json` in the following way:\n\n    - `extensions/connectionProperties/authentication/.../secretId` - Link to the secret in your Key Vault that contains the certificate\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS GENEVA ACTIONS EXTENSION<|>SERVICE<|>LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions (LTM GA) extension allows for programmatic creation of LTM rules as part of your EV2 deployment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EV2<|>SERVICE<|>Ev2 is a deployment framework that facilitates the deployment and management of services like the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AAD IDENTITY<|>ROLE<|>AAD identity is used for authentication and authorization in the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension, allowing access to Geneva Logs and Metrics accounts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Logs account is a service that stores log data and is managed through the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA METRICS ACCOUNT<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Metrics account is a service that provides metrics data and is also managed through the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLLOUTSPEC.JSON<|>CONFIGURATION<|>RolloutSpec.json is a configuration file used as the root EV2 file for running the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICEMODEL.JSON<|>CONFIGURATION<|>ServiceModel.json is a configuration file that defines the service structure and properties for the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLLOUTPARAMETERS.JSON<|>CONFIGURATION<|>RolloutParameters.json is a configuration file that contains parameters for the rollout process of the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGSTOMETRICS GENEVA ACTIONS EXTENSION<|>EV2<|>The LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension is designed to work within the EV2 deployment framework for managing log and metrics rules.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AAD IDENTITY<|>GENEVA LOGS ACCOUNT<|>The AAD identity is required to authenticate and authorize access to the Geneva Logs account for creating and updating LTM rules.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AAD IDENTITY<|>GENEVA METRICS ACCOUNT<|>The AAD identity is also used to authenticate and authorize access to the Geneva Metrics account for managing metrics data.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROLLOUTSPEC.JSON<|>LOGSTOMETRICS GENEVA ACTIONS EXTENSION<|>RolloutSpec.json serves as the root configuration file necessary for executing the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICEMODEL.JSON<|>LOGSTOMETRICS GENEVA ACTIONS EXTENSION<|>ServiceModel.json contains service definitions that are essential for the proper functioning of the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROLLOUTPARAMETERS.JSON<|>LOGSTOMETRICS GENEVA ACTIONS EXTENSION<|>RolloutParameters.json provides necessary parameters that are utilized by the LogsToMetrics Geneva Actions extension during its execution.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
