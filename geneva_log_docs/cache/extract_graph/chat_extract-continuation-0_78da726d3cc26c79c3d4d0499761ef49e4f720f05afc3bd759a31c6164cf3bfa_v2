Account Management Limits\n\nGeneva Logs impose certain restrictions on the number of resources a given account can contain in order to ensure that all accounts in an environment can be serviced fairly without the chance of one, or a few, large accounts impacting others. \n\nResource|Quota\n--------|------\nStorage shards|500\nUser roles|50\nConfigurations (major versions)|300\nConfigurations (minor versions)|3000\n\nThese limits are high enough to meet the needs of most services. However, if an account exceeds these restrictions it should be split up into two or more accounts to stay under the limits. Alternatively unused entities may be deleted. \n\n### II. Logs processing limits\nGeneva does not currently impose input/output operations per second (IOPS) limits at a [Geneva namespace](concepts/namespace.md)) level level.\n\nHowever, [Geneva configuration](Howtoguides/Manageconfig/configmanagement.md) can certainly affect performance and your ability to meet SLAs. \nFor example, as logs IOPS load is sharded across monikers of a namespace, suboptimally-managed storage accounts may reduce your overall IOPS.\n\nSo, to prioritize performance of your namespace, please consider the following recommendations for configuring your Geneva namespace resource topology:\n1. Use [GSM](../logs/concepts/WhatIsGsm.md) for your namespace.\n    * Why? GSM will automatically handle the provisioning and management of your namespace’s resources, like storage and event hubs.\n    \n        >i. Such management will reduce your need to understand and optimize configurations for monikers in the namespace.\n\n2. If you’re not able to use [GSM](../logs/concepts/WhatIsGSM.md):\n    * a. Ensure that each Logs Account complies with above limits\n    * b. Review for throttling and/or connectivity issues at ingestion, both primary signs that a configuration is suboptimal\n\n        >i. To check for throttling, review ‘Failures and Throttling’ metrics in the [Agent QoS dashboard](../collect/advanced/agentqos.md)\n\n        >ii. To improve for throttling, make sure that the [auto-inflate TU](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-auto-inflate) TU setting is enabled on your Event Hubs \n\n    * c.\tLimit Event Hub ingress rate to 100k events per minute\n\n        >i. Technically EventHub could sustain higher IOPS, but consumption rate is limited by other factors as well \n\n### III. Schema limit per event\nCurrently, Geneva pipeline has the limit of 100 schemas per event for Cosmos Uploader.\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>SERVICE<|>Geneva Logs is a service that provides logging capabilities and manages log data for various accounts and configurations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT LIMITS<|>PARAMETER<|>Account Management Limits define the restrictions on the number of resources an account can contain to ensure fair service across all accounts in an environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGS PROCESSING LIMITS<|>PARAMETER<|>Logs Processing Limits refer to the constraints on input/output operations per second (IOPS) that can affect performance and service level agreements (SLAs) in Geneva.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA NAMESPACE<|>NAMESPACE<|>Geneva Namespace is a logical container for managing resources and configurations related to logging services in Geneva.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA CONFIGURATION<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Geneva Configuration refers to the settings and parameters that can affect the performance of the logging service and its ability to meet SLAs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GSM<|>SERVICE<|>GSM (Geneva Service Management) is a service that automatically handles the provisioning and management of resources for a Geneva namespace, including storage and event hubs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT HUB<|>SERVICE<|>Event Hub is a service that ingests and processes large amounts of event data in real-time, which is utilized by Geneva for logging purposes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGENT QOS DASHBOARD<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>Agent QoS Dashboard is a monitoring tool that provides metrics related to failures and throttling in the ingestion process of logs.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT LIMITS<|>Geneva Logs enforces Account Management Limits to ensure fair resource distribution among accounts in the logging service.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>LOGS PROCESSING LIMITS<|>Geneva Logs is affected by Logs Processing Limits, which can impact performance and SLAs.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA LOGS<|>GENEVA NAMESPACE<|>Geneva Logs operates within a Geneva Namespace, which organizes and manages logging resources.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA NAMESPACE<|>GENEVA CONFIGURATION<|>Geneva Namespace configurations can influence the performance of the logging service and its ability to meet SLAs.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA NAMESPACE<|>GSM<|>GSM is utilized to manage the resources of a Geneva Namespace, optimizing performance and resource allocation.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA NAMESPACE<|>EVENT HUB<|>Event Hub is integrated with the Geneva Namespace to handle the ingestion of event data for logging purposes.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGENT QOS DASHBOARD<|>LOGS PROCESSING LIMITS<|>The Agent QoS Dashboard provides metrics that can help identify issues related to Logs Processing Limits, such as throttling.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
