Therefore, before enabling selective indexing, you should go through the following steps:\n\n1. Create a Kusto cluster and enable [ingestion from Geneva](../../../../connectors/Geneva%20to%20Kusto/overview.md). DGrep is not connected to GDS, new customers should still follow the GDS path for Kusto ingestion and on top of that complete the prerequisites step of the legacy path.\n1. If the kusto cluster's URL is https://clusterName.**region**.kusto.windows.net, go to [Jarvis > Actions > AzureLogAnalyticsControlPlane > DGrep > AddKustoClusterUrlOverride](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/748E392A?genevatraceguid=80ced77c-3b3f-4d4b-8db2-bbd32bc6cfb5), enter your kusto Cluster's URL in *Kusto URL Override* field. The update might take a few minutes. For any issue, please open ticket to [DGrep](https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/create?tmpl=qD3J3Q).\n1. Authorize DGrep to read from your Kusto database. This can be done by running the following command in your cluster:\n   ```javascript\n   .add database <database name> viewers ('dstsapp=dgrep.prod.pipeline.msftcloudes.com')\n   ```\n\n## Selective Indexing on Events\n\nLet's suppose that you want to enable selective indexing on columns UserId and ActivityId of an event called Operation.\n\n### 1. Create a derived event\n\nCreate a derived event with `source=\"Operation\", storeType=\"CentralBond\" and whereToRun=\"Local\"`. This event will contain the index for event Operation. You can give this event any name -- in the example below, we are calling it OperationIndex.\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Operation\" eventName=\"OperationIndex\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" whereToRun=\"Local\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n\n### 2. Add query to the event\n\nAdd the following query to the derived event definition.\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Operation\" eventName=\"OperationIndex\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" whereToRun=\"Local\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n  <Query><![CDATA[\n    groupby Identity(), UserId, ActivityId\n    let __EndTime__ = EndOfQueryInterval()\n  ]]></Query>\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n\n### 3. Add Identity definitions\n\nIf Operation is an IFX event, add identity column definitions to the derived event query:\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Operation\" eventName=\"OperationIndex\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" whereToRun=\"Local\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n  <Query><![CDATA[\n    let Tenant = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MONITORING_TENANT\")\n    let Role = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MONITORING_ROLE\")\n    let RoleInstance = GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MONITORING_ROLE_INSTANCE\")\n    groupby Identity(), UserId, ActivityId\n    let __EndTime__ = EndOfQueryInterval()\n  ]]></Query>\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n\n### 4. Add EventStreamingAnnotation\n\n* Add an EventStreamingAnnotation called SelectiveIndexing to the Operation event. Please make sure that the regular expression on the EventStreamingAnnotation element matches only the Operation event.\n  Also Add the derived event name in the SelectiveIndex annotation content.\n\n    ```xml\n    <EventStreamingAnnotation name=\"^Operation$\">\n    <SelectiveIndexing>\n        <Content>OperationIndex</Content>\n    </SelectiveIndexing>\n    </EventStreamingAnnotation>\n    ```\n\n* Add an EventStreamingAnnotation to the DerivedEvent that will send it to your Kusto table.\n\n    ```xml\n    <EventStreamingAnnotation name=\"^OperationIndex$\">\n      <LogAnalytics>\n        <Content>LogAnalyticsContent</Content>\n      </LogAnalytics>\n    </EventStreamingAnnotation>\n    ```\n\n### 5. Update version\n\nIncrement the namespace configuration version. This step is necessary to ensure that the index will be only be used to search new data.\n\n### 6. Upload the configuration\n\nUpload the new configuration to Geneva and deploy it to your service.\n\n## Selective Indexing on derived events\n\nEnabling selective indexing on derived events requires a special treatment and can only be done by manually editing the namespace configuration. \n\nSuppose that Operation is a derived event with source event Foo:\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Foo\" eventName=\"Operation\" storeType=\"CentralBond\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n  <Query><![CDATA[\n    where OperationName != \"\"\n  ]]></Query>\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n\nIn order to enable selective indexing on event Operation, please perform the following steps.\n\n### 1. Create a new derived event\n\nCreate a new derived event with `source = Foo` and `storeType = Local`. Let's call it OperationLocal.\n\n### 2. Copy over the query\n\nCopy the derived event query from Operation to OperationLocal.\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"Foo\" eventName=\"OperationLocal\" storeType=\"Local\" duration=\"PT5M\">\n  <Query><![CDATA[\n    where OperationName != \"\"\n  ]]></Query>\n</DerivedEvent>\n```\n### 3. Edit the original derived event\n\nChange Operation's definition so that it has `source=\"OperationLocal\"` and an empty query:\n\n```xml\n<DerivedEvent source=\"OperationLocal\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SELECTIVE INDEXING<|>EVENT<|>Selective indexing is a process that allows for the optimization of data retrieval by indexing specific columns of events, enhancing query performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMESPACE CONFIGURATION<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Namespace configuration is a setup that defines the parameters and settings for managing events and data within a specific namespace in Geneva.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUSTO CLUSTER<|>SERVICE<|>A Kusto cluster is a data storage and analytics service that allows for the ingestion and querying of large datasets, often used in conjunction with Geneva for event indexing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>EVENT<|>A derived event is an event that is created based on another event, allowing for additional processing and indexing of specific data points within the original event.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPERATION<|>EVENT<|>Operation is an event that captures specific activities or transactions, which can be indexed for improved data retrieval and analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPERATIONINDEX<|>EVENT<|>OperationIndex is a derived event created to index the Operation event, allowing for efficient querying of its data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENTSTREAMINGANNOTATION<|>EVENT<|>EventStreamingAnnotation is a metadata element that provides additional context or instructions for processing events, such as indexing or logging.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING_TENANT<|>PARAMETER<|>Monitoring tenant is a variable that holds the identifier for the tenant being monitored, used in queries to filter data appropriately.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING_ROLE<|>PARAMETER<|>Monitoring role is a variable that specifies the role associated with the monitoring process, used to tailor data retrieval based on role-specific criteria.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING_ROLE_INSTANCE<|>PARAMETER<|>Monitoring role instance is a variable that identifies the specific instance of a role being monitored, providing granularity in data analysis.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAMESPACE CONFIGURATION<|>SELECTIVE INDEXING<|>Selective indexing is enabled by modifying the namespace configuration to specify which events and columns to index.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KUSTO CLUSTER<|>SELECTIVE INDEXING<|>Selective indexing requires a Kusto cluster to host the indexed events and facilitate data ingestion.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DERIVED EVENT<|>OPERATION<|>The derived event OperationIndex is created based on the Operation event to enable selective indexing of its data.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVENTSTREAMINGANNOTATION<|>OPERATION<|>EventStreamingAnnotation is used to enhance the Operation event with additional metadata for indexing purposes.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING_TENANT<|>MONITORING_ROLE<|>Monitoring tenant and monitoring role are parameters that are used together in queries to filter and analyze event data effectively.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONITORING_ROLE<|>MONITORING_ROLE_INSTANCE<|>Monitoring role instance is a specific instance of the monitoring role, providing detailed context for data analysis related to that role.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
