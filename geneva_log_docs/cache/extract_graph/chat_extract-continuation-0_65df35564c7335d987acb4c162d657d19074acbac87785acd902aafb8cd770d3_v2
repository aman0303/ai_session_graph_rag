Delete the deactivated moniker resources (e.g. storage account and EH resources) from your subscription.\n\n## Automatically update your existing non-AZ monikers to AZ\n\n>[!Note]\n>Contact the [Geneva Logs control plane team](mailto:@warmpathAZ@microsoft.com) to enable the automatic update of your non-AZ monikers to AZ\n\nIf your Geneva Logs account is GSM-enabled, you can [opt-in](mailto:@warmpathAZ@microsoft.com) to allow GSM to automatically update your existing monikers. The GSM health monitor will scan your monikers on a regular basis, and ensure that the storage replication type of your storage accounts matches the setting on the [Storage group level](#how-to-configure-the-preferred-storage-replication-type-on-a-storage-group-level) or the [Logs account level](#how-to-configure-the-preferred-storage-replication-type-on-the-logs-account-level) (if no Storage group level setting is available). If there is a mismatch, GSM will deactivate the existing monikers with the mismatching storage accounts, and provision new monikers instead with storage accounts with the requested replication strategy and AZ-enabled Event Hubs (depending on region availability). Deactivating a moniker will keep the logs stored in this moniker available for query in case there is an issue, but it will ensure that no new telemetry is emitted to that moniker. When the data retention period passes, the deactivated monikers can be [deleted](./monikerdelete.md). GSM will run this automatic moniker update process every time it identifies a new storage replication setting.\n\n>[!Note]\n>Once you opt-in to allow GSM to automatically update your existing monikers to AZ, GSM will continuously ensure your GSM-managed storage accounts match your preferred replication startegy. That means that each time you update your replication type choice at the account or storage group level, GSM will apply this change automatically. As a result, every time you make a change to the replication startegy choice, you can expect a temporary increase in the number of monikers in your account. \n>We recommend registering additional subscriptions to your logs account to ensure sufficient capacity for GSM to provision additional monikers. \n\n>[!Note]\n>If ZRS is not yet available in a region, and you only specify ZRS as your replication strategy choice (and you do not provide multiple values as described [here](#storage-accounts)), the migration will fail. Once ZRS becomes available in the region, GSM will be able to complete the migration process automatically. \n\n### How to migrate the monikers from Standard_GRS to Standard_ZRS. What are the configuration settings?\n\nBefore onboarding to Geneva auto migration, MDS account owners should configure the preferred replication types by using one of two options mentioned below:\n\n1. **Standard__ZRS**: All monikers with Standard_GRS/Standard_LRS replication type will be migrated to Standard_ZRS in regions where Standard_ZRS is supported. For regions that do not support Standard_ZRS replication type, these monikers will be migrated only when the region adds Standard_ZRS support in the future.\n2. **Standard__ZRS, Standard__LRS**: All monikers with Standard_GRS/Standard_LRS replication type will be migrated to Standard_ZRS in regions where Standard_ZRS is supported. For the regions that do not support Standard_ZRS, monikers will be migrated to Standard_LRS. Monikers which already belong to the Standard_LRS replication type will continue to stay as-is. \n\n>[!Note]\n> For the regions that do not support Standard_ZRS replication type, if the user wants monikers with Standard_GRS replication type to temporarily move to Standard_LRS replication type until the region adds support for Standard_ZRS replication type: then the user can choose to configure Option 2, observe the desired migrations, and then update the configuration settings to Option 1.\n\n### Regions that support availability zones in Azure\nPlease refer to this [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-region) for list of regions.\n\n<!-- Image links -->\n[EditReplicationType]: ../../../logs/images/AZ-edit-RepType1.png \"Edit Storage Replication Type(s)\"\n[UpdateReplicationType]: ../../../logs/images/AZ-edit-RepType2.png \"Update Storage Replication Type(s)\"\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DEACTIVATEMONIKER<|>COMMAND<|>DeactivateMoniker is a command used to deactivate specific monikers in the Geneva Logs system, ensuring that no new telemetry is emitted to those monikers while retaining access to existing logs for querying.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIENTCERT<|>PARAMETER<|>Clientcert is an optional parameter that can be used in the DeactivateMoniker command to specify client certificate authentication for secure connections.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DGREP<|>MONITORING AGENT<|>DGrep is a monitoring agent used to observe data flows to newly provisioned monikers, ensuring that data is processed without disruption.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUSTO<|>SERVICE<|>Kusto is a service that provides a platform for querying and analyzing large datasets, often used in conjunction with data from Geneva Logs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COSMOS<|>SERVICE<|>Cosmos is a service that offers a globally distributed database for managing data across multiple regions, often utilized for storing log data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GSM<|>SERVICE<|>GSM (Geneva Service Management) is a service that manages the health and configuration of monikers, ensuring they are updated according to specified replication strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONIKER<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Moniker is a configuration entity in Geneva Logs that represents a logical grouping of resources for logging and telemetry purposes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORAGE ACCOUNT<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Storage account is a configuration entity that provides a storage solution for log data, with various replication strategies available.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT HUB<|>SERVICE<|>Event Hub is a service that ingests and processes large amounts of telemetry data in real-time, often used in conjunction with Geneva Logs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD_GRS<|>PARAMETER<|>Standard_GRS is a parameter that specifies the replication strategy for storage accounts, providing geo-redundant storage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD_ZRS<|>PARAMETER<|>Standard_ZRS is a parameter that specifies the replication strategy for storage accounts, providing zone-redundant storage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD_LRS<|>PARAMETER<|>Standard_LRS is a parameter that specifies the replication strategy for storage accounts, providing locally redundant storage.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEACTIVATEMONIKER<|>CLIENTCERT<|>The DeactivateMoniker command can utilize the clientcert parameter for secure authentication during the deactivation process.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>KUSTO<|>DGrep monitors data flows that are subsequently analyzed and queried using the Kusto service.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DGREP<|>COSMOS<|>DGrep ensures that data flows to Cosmos for storage and retrieval without disruption.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GSM<|>MONIKER<|>GSM manages the health and configuration of monikers, ensuring they are updated according to the specified replication strategies.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER<|>STORAGE ACCOUNT<|>Monikers are associated with storage accounts that hold the log data generated by the telemetry system.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONIKER<|>EVENT HUB<|>Monikers are used to group resources that send telemetry data to Event Hubs for processing.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD_GRS<|>STANDARD_ZRS<|>The migration process involves changing monikers from Standard_GRS to Standard_ZRS based on region support for replication strategies.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD_GRS<|>STANDARD_LRS<|>Monikers can be migrated from Standard_GRS to Standard_LRS if Standard_ZRS is not supported in the region.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
