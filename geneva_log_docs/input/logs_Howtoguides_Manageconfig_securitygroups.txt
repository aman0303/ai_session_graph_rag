## Create Security Groups in [IdWeb][IdWeb]


The Security Groups created for Geneva Logs must all be onboarded to dSTS for Geneva Logs authentication and authorization to work correctly. 
dSTS team levies strict rules on SGs that can be onboarded to dSTS. Geneva team does not stipulate these rules. 
Before you create the SGs it is imperative that you follow all the dSTS requirements by consulting their [Access Control Wiki][AccessControlWiki]

In [IdWeb][IdWeb] create your Security Groups (SG). The scope for Security Group **must be DomainLocal** as you cannot nest people from domains other than Redmond for the Universal Redmond SG's. Any SG registered with Geneva Logs must be in redmond, AME, Torus, RXME and EXME domains (latter 2 are specific for LX environments). You can have multiple SG's registered as admins.

Or, You can use [MyAccess][MyAccess] to create a team/project and manage access. Typically Security groups appear in your token like RRD-&lt;group-id&gt;

>[!Note]
>[MyAccess](https://myaccess/identityiq/home.jsf) is retiring on FY21 Q4, and will be replaced with [CoreIdentity](https://coreidentity.microsoft.com/).

For AME based access and Security groups, please log on with your AME credentials. Use [OneIdentity][OneIdentity] to verify that you are part of the listed AME based Security Groups.

## FAQ

You could see the following while onboarding security groups

### Error: Failed to read Redmond Group type for group *"REDMOND\Foobar". Response is not successful: Not Found

![Error Image 5][ErrorImage5]

A. If you just created the Security group, it may take up to 24 hours for it to get reflected. Please wait and try again. Please use the links above to determine membership and whether you see your Security Group in this list. Check for errors in the group name. You may need log in again to refresh the token.

Note: Security Groups that are added to User Roles must be onboarded to dSTS. You can onboard an SG to dSTS through a self-service portal (Go to aka.ms/dscm and choose Release Security Group option). Alternatively, you can use Jarvis UX to simultaneously onboard the SG to dSTS. [Learn More][ControlAccessToLogs]
