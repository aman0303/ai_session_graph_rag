# Quality of Service Dashboard

To check the health of your conversion rules, you can view the LogsToMetricsQos dashboard.

This dashboard helps understand and diagnose the Logs To Metrics connector service.
 It gives an overview of:

* Service usage per Geneva Logs namespace
* Performance and latencies
* Processing failures
* Throttling

To access this dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Manage->Connectors->Logs to metrics](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/?page=settings&mode=connectors&tab=dgrep)
2. Select an *endpoint*.
3. Select a Geneva Logs *namespace* containing your LTM rules.
4. Click on **Rule Health** link for a rule whose health you want to observe.

## *Usage* section

The *Usage* section of the dashboard shows the following charts:

1. **Processed blobs/s** : The number of blobs processed per second by the LogsToMetrics connector service for each Geneva Logs namespace.
2. **Processed bytes/s** : The number of bytes processed per second by the LogsToMetrics connector service for each Geneva Logs namespace.
3. **Consumed computation units/s** : The number of computation units consumed per second by each LogsToMetrics rule. A computation unit is equivalent to a millisecond of CPU time.
4. **Published metrics/s** : The number of metrics published to Geneva Metrics service per second by each LogsToMetrics rule.

## *Throttling* section

The *Throttling* section of the dashboard shows the following charts:

1. **Throttled blobs/s** : The number of blobs throttled per second by the LogsToMetrics connector service for each Geneva Logs namespace.
2. **Throttled bytes/s** : The number of bytes throttled per second by the LogsToMetrics connector service for each Geneva Logs namespace.
3. **Throttled computation units/s** : The estimated number of computation units throttled per second for each LogsToMetrics rule. A computation unit is equivalent to a millisecond of CPU time.
4. **Throttled metrics/s** : The estimated number of metrics throttled per second for each LogsToMetrics rule.

See [Limits and Quotas](./quota.md), for more details about throttling.

## *Latency* section

The *Latency* section of the dashboard shows the following charts:

1. **Rule processing time** : Time spent running a rule against the contents of a blob. This is a product of the average blob size and the rule's computational complexity.
2. **Blob processing time** : Time spent processing each blob. This includes the time spent downloading the blob from storage and the rule processing time.
3. **Geneva latency per blob** : Time elapsed from the moment a blob is uploaded to Geneva until the corresponding metrics are published to Geneva Metrics. This includes the blob processing time and queueing time.
4. **End-to-end metric latency** : Average time spent from the moment a log event is emitted from your service until the corresponding metrics are published to Geneva Metrics. This includes the Geneva latency per blob and the blob upload period.

>[!Note]  
>This metric relies on the timestamp contained in the log event, so it is only as accurate as the timestamps provided by your service.

## *Processing failures* section

The *Processing failures* section shows the following charts:
(Note, please, see our [troubleshooting documentation](../../Troubleshooting/L2Mtroubleshooting.md) for help fixing some of these errors).

1. **Metric publishing failures** : The number of metrics that failed to be emitted, along with a status code. These are the possible status codes:
   * *OldMetric*: The metric timestamp is more than 20 minutes in the past.
   * *FutureMetric*: The metric timestamp is more than 5 minutes in the future.
   * *NullDimension*: A dimension value was null or empty.
   * *LongDimension*: A dimension value length is greater than the maximum allowed (1024 characters).
   * *NegativeMetricValue*: The metric value was negative.
   * *MetricValueOverflow*: The metric value is greater than the maximum allowed (Int64.MaxValue).
2. **Rule processing failures** : The number of failures while trying to apply a rule to a blob, along with a status code. These are the possible status codes:
     * *ParsingError*: There was an error parsing the rule.
     * *PropertyNotPresent*: A property specified in the rule does not exist in the blob.
     * *NoTimePropertyDefined*: The rule output contains no timestamp column (please, see our [documentation](gettingstarted.md) about defining rules).
     * *NoMetricDefined*: The rule output contains no metric column (please, see our [documentation](gettingstarted.md) about defining rules).
3. **Blob processing failures** : The number of failures while trying to process a blob. These errors should be rare and usually indicate an issue deserializing the blob. If you see these errors and are unsure about the cause, please, contact [Geneva Support](https://aka.ms/genevasupport).
