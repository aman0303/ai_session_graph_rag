# Extensibility SDK FAQ
Start here: [Extensibility SDK Overview](~/logs/references/extensibilitysdk/intro.md).

## Where do I download the NuGet package?
See [Using the Extensibility SDK](~/logs/references/extensibilitysdk/usage.md).

## Where is the sample code?
Samples are available here:

- [Using the Extensibility SDK](~/logs/references/extensibilitysdk/usage.md)
- [Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk.Samples](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/GenevaLogs-Extensibility-SDK?path=/src/Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk.Samples)

## What information do I need before I escalate?
- Your Extensibility SDK parameters, including your Logs environment, account, event filters, and authentication credentials (certificate or managed identity).
- Your Extensibility SDK telemetry, including your SDK Logs environment, account, and namespace.
  For more information, see [Using the Extensibility SDK - TelemetryDetails](~/logs/references/extensibilitysdk/usage.md#telemetrydetails).

  > [!WARNING]
  > **We require that telemetry be collected and exported to Geneva Monitoring to entertain support requests.**

## Is there a limit on the number of concurrent processors for an Event Hub?
Yes, each Event Hub partition can have only one processor per consumer group at any given time.
If an Event Hub partition has multiple processors per consumer group, unexpected errors may occur.

To support additional consumers, you can add up to 20 consumer groups to an Event Hub.
You must add consumer groups in Jarvis, not directly in Azure Portal.
You are not charged for extra consumer groups.
For more information, see [Getting Started - Step 2: Create an event hub consumer group](~/logs/references/extensibilitysdk/gettingstarted.md#step-2-create-an-event-hub-consumer-group).


# Original Extensibility SDK FAQ

> [!WARNING]
> The original Extensibility SDK will be out of support when the .NET Standard version is generally available.

## Where do I download the original NuGet package?
The package is available from the ADO artifact feed: [Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DataPipe.EventStreamExtension](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_artifacts/feed/Official/NuGet/Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DataPipe.EventStreamExtension).

## Where is the original sample code?
The sample code is available in the [EngSys-MDA-Samples-ExtensibilitySDK Git repository on MSAzure](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/One/_git/EngSys-MDA-Samples-ExtensibilitySDK). We provide both OneBranch/CoreXT and standalone examples.

## How can I validate my Geneva Logs config, ServiceBusAccountInfo, and XStoreAccountInfo are correct?
The [Mds Streaming Diagnostics Tool](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/WAG/EngSys/Monitor/AmdWiki/Mds%20Streaming%20Diagnostics%20Tool.aspx) can be used to validate that you have provided all the necessary configuration information to MDS.
