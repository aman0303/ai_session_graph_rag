# Getting Started 

To use the Geneva Extensibility SDK, you need to:
1. Ensure the events of interest are configured for streaming (i.e. appear in DGrep).
2. Create a new Event Hub consumer group for the SDK to use.
3. Authorize the SDK to read your data.

# Step 1: Configure the events of interest for streaming

If the events are already in DGrep, you are done. Otherwise, see [here](../../concepts/DGrepoverview.md).

# Step 2: Create an event hub consumer group

Use the Geneva UI to create a consumer group to consume the data. There are a few restrictions here: 

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not create consumer groups in the Azure Portal.**
> Consumer groups must be created in the Geneva UI.

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not use the consumer groups called `$Default`, `LogAnalyticsConsumer`, `GenevaAnalyticsConsumer`, or `GenevaReservedConsumer`.**
> By default, every Event Hub has a consumer group called `$Default`.
> In addition, all Event Hubs associated with Geneva streams have consumer groups called `LogAnalyticsConsumer`, `GenevaAnalyticsConsumer`, and `GenevaReservedConsumer`.
> These groups are reserved for Geneva use.
> These consumer groups should not be used for any reason.
> No support will be provided if this is violated, and you will likely encounter data loss.

To create consumer groups in [Jarvis](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/): 

- Navigate to [Account > Logs Account Settings > Resources](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/account/logs/resources).

- The step to add the consumer group depends on whether or not you are using a [GSM enabled account](~/logs/concepts/WhatIsGSM.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > GSM enabled accounts are strongly encouraged over non-GSM accounts.

  - For a GSM enabled account, click on the appropriate storage group.
    This will take you to a page where you can update the group settings.
    Under the "Streaming settings...", add the new consumer group and click on Save.

  - For non-GSM accounts, the Resources page contains the list of monikers in your account.
    Pick the moniker(s) of interest.
    Under the section "Event Hub", add the new consumer group and click on Update Azure Resources.

    > [!WARNING]
    > GSM enabled accounts are strongly encouraged so that storage accounts are automatically configured for you.
    > If you are using a non-GSM account, you need to ensure that your storage account is configured correctly.
    > Azure Event Hubs requires that the following storage account blob service settings are disabled:
    >
    > - Hierarchical namespace
    > - Blob soft delete
    > - Versioning
    >
    > For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs - Checkpointing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#checkpointing).

# Step 3: Authorize the SDK to read your data

You can authenticate to Geneva using either a certificate or managed identity (MSI).

> [!NOTE]
> The original Extensibility SDK `Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DataPipe.EventStreamExtension` only supports certificate authentication.
>
> The .NET Standard Extensibility SDK `Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk` supports both certificate and MSI authentication.

Follow these steps to authorize your credentials to have read permissions for the namespaces and events that you are interested in.

- Create your certificate or MSI for Geneva Logs.

  - For an Azure Key Vault (AKV) certificate, follow the steps here: [Create a new Azure KeyVault (AKV) certificate](~/collect/authentication/keyvaultcreatecert.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The .NET Standard Extensibility SDK supports [Azure KeyVault (AKV) Certificates](~/collect/authentication/keyvault.md).
    > It does not support [Unmanaged Certificates](~/collect/authentication/unmanaged.md).

    The certificate needs to be installed into the local machine or current user certificate store for the SDK.

  - For an MSI, follow the steps here: [How to use Managed Identities in Geneva Logs](~/collect/authentication/managedidentitylogs.md#how-to-use-managed-identities-in-geneva-logs).

    The MSI needs to be configured on the Azure resource as usual.
    For example, see:

    - [Configure managed identities on Azure virtual machines (VMs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-configure-managed-identities)
    - [Configure managed identities for Azure resources on a virtual machine scale set](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-configure-managed-identities-scale-sets)

- Create a user role or use an existing one.
  To add a user role, navigate to [Account > Logs Account Settings > User Roles](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/account/logs/userRoles).
  Click on Add User Role and follow the steps there.
  We suggest that you create and use a ReadOnly user role.

- Add your credentials to the user role.

  - For an AKV certificate, follow the steps here: [Authorize Azure KeyVault (AKV) certificates in your Geneva Logs account](~/collect/authentication/keyvaultlogsauthorize.md).

  - For an MSI, follow the steps here: [Register the MI in Jarvis](~/collect/authentication/managedidentitylogs.md#register-the-mi-in-jarvis-1).

- Next add a Streaming claim to the user role.
  To add this claim, click on View / Add claims, select Streaming, fill in the Account (Regex), select the Right from the drop down list, and click on Add.
