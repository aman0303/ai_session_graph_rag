# FAQ


## What types of events show up in DGrep?
Events configured with type CentralBond or those that have streaming annotations will be searchable via DGrep.

## How long are events searchable in DGrep?
Events will be searchable as long as their retention period specifies. This can be configured for the whole account using [**defaultRetentionInDays**](../../collect/references/windows/events.md#attributes) or per event type using the [**retentionInDays**](../../collect/references/windows/events.md#attributes-1) attribute on the event source.

## Why is my namespace/event/column still appearing in DGrep even after I removed it?
DGrep list of namespaces, events and columns is built on hinting of data that was ingested. To remove these hints, use the "Clear namespace/event hints" dialog, which can be opened from the Settings tab.

![clear hints image](../images/dgrep_ClearHints.png)

You will need access to the namespace to be able to remove hints from it.

## Cosmos/Kusto show duplicate records whereas there is no duplication in DGrep
If MA sends multiple event hub notifications for a blob (due to retries, or misconfigurations), data will be duplicated in Cosmos and Kusto. DGrep has no dependency on event hub notifications -- it searches the storage account directly.  Hence, there will be no duplicates in DGrep data for this situation.

## I see duplicate results after using the `summarize` or `groupby` operators. Why?
DGrep is a distributed service and runs your *server* query on mulitiple machines. Therefore, `summarize` and `groupby` expressions are scoped to a single BLOB. To get expeced results, add your `summarize` or `groupby` expression to the *client* query as well. The client query runs on a single node and operates across all the data. There is an example of how to do this [here](../concepts/serverquery.md#distributed-nature).

## How do I share a link to a DGrep query?
Click on the "Link" tab in the left pane:

## How to create parameterized link for DGrep? How can I programmatically create it?

You can use DGrep parameters to generate a link to a query.
For example for this link:
```
https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/?page=logs&be=DGrep&time=04/13/2015 11:35Z&offset=-30&offsetUnit=Mins&UTC=true&ep=Test&ns=Aims&en=LogEvent&ver=3v0&su=MdsBvt1,MdsBvt2&role=Aims&roleInstance=Aims_IN_0, Aims_IN_1&conditions=[["Tenant","%3D%3D","a"],["ActivityId","contains any of","a,b,c"]]
```

fields are:
* ep: Endpoint,
* ns: namespace,
* en: eventname,
* ver: table version,
* su: Scaleunit [obsolete (use scopingConditions) ] ,
* role: Scaleunit [obsolete (use scopingConditions)],
* roleInstance: Scaleunit [obsolete (use scopingConditions)],
* conditions: Search conditions (Condition names are Case sensitive)

You can easily figure out other params in this link and craft your own.

* The 'time' arg should specify timezone otherwise it will be considered client's timezone. (Either use Z(UTC) or the standard "-hh:mm" timezone format).
* The 'offset' and 'offsetUnits' parameters specify the range around the given 'time'; valid 'offsetUnits' are "Mins", "Hours", and "Days", with `offset` being the quantity of those to use.
* The 'UTC' arg is used to display/convert the provided time into either user's local time or UTC.
* Parameterized link also supports aggregates, here is the example(Count by Role and Count by Level):
```
https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/?page=logs&be=DGrep&offset=-2&offsetUnit=Hours&UTC=false&ep=Test&ns=Aims&en=LogEvent&ver=3v0&su=MdsBvt1,MdsBvt2&role=Aims&roleInstance=Aims_IN_0,%20Aims_IN_1&aggregates=["Count by Role", "Count by Level"]&aggregatesVisible=true
```
* You can also use the "dateFrom" and "dateTo" parameters like following:
    ```dateFrom=<YourTime>&dateTo=<YourTime>```
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using dateFrom and dateTo then don't use time, offset and offsetunits in parameters

    > [!NOTE]
    > (dateFrom and dateTo fields always changes time to UTC, so it is advised to use offset, offsetUnit and time params for local times)

* You can have the search be relative to now by omitting the time parameter and just using offset and offsetunits
* You can also use the dateFrom and dateTo parameters like following
* You can also use scopingConditions , Like: scopingConditions=[["DataCenter","PROD-BY-001"],["OtherIdentityColumn","Value"]]
    > [!NOTE]
    > Monikers and EventVersions are special scoping conditions. Please use "__Moniker__" and "__EventVersion__" for name in URL.
* For server query you can use parameter: serverQuery
