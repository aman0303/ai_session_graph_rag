# General Onboarding & Migration 

### Do we have to create a new subscription for our services, or we can use an existing subscription that we already have in place for Geneva Logs? 

We recommend having one or more subscriptions dedicated to Geneva Logs only. You can also use existing subscriptions. 

### We are in Fairfax and is [second step](../../Howtoguides/EV2/ev2.md) applicable to us? 

Please follow the general steps to create and deploy Ev2 files. If an account already exists, you should add the permissions.

### Permissions are manually done on RBAC. Are we supposed to do these again in the Ev2 template? 

You don't need a subscription that is dedicated to Ev2, but you do need a subscription that is dedicated to Geneva Logs.

### Security groups for Geneva control access â€“ Redmond SG or AME? 

Redmond security group 

### Will all existing Geneva logs certs be replaced by ones we specify in the Ev2 template or will it just append? 

It will append.
