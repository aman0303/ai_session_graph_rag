5. After clicking on "Generate" button you will see generated chart query comes to chart query editor. After running this query you can see the chart

6. You can also pin this chart to dashboard using "Pin to Dashboard" button 
   
> [!NOTE]  
> This functionality is not recommended - for creating dashboards with charts based on logs, please convert your logs to metrics using either directly via 
> [IFx APIs](../../../collect/instrument/ifx/ifx.md) or less efficiently with [local derived events](../../../collect/advanced/derivedintro.md), or if 
> needed the [Logs-to-Metrics connector](../Logs2Metrics/overview.md).

## Few things to note about DGrep chart query:

### Time Charts

1. Query should return at least one Timestamp column. This column will be used for time axis of chart.
    * If there are multiple Timestamp columns, then first Timestamp column will be used.
2. There can be multiple number of numeric column in the result of the query and all column will be treated as different series(legend).
3. If query will return one string column, then UI will find all different values from this column and create multiple legends by combining with numeric columns

For example, if Data is:

|Timestamp|NumericColumn1|NumericColumn2|StringColumn
|--|--|---|--|
|T1|1|5|Foo|
|T2|2|6|Bar|
|T3|3|7|Foo|
|T4|4|8|Bar|

Legends will be: (Foo, NumericColumn1), (Foo, NumericColumn2), (Bar, NumericColumn1), (Bar, NumericColumn2)

Series will be:

* (Foo, NumericColumn1), = (T1,1), (T3,3)
* (Foo, NumericColumn2), = (T1,5), (T3,7)
* (Bar, NumericColumn1), = (T2,2), (T4,4)
* (Bar, NumericColumn2) = (T2,6), (T4,8)

If there are multiple string columns, then only first string column will be used as above and others will be ignored.

### Category Charts

1. Query should return at least one string column. This column will be used for X-axis of chart.
    * If there are multiple string columns, then first string column will be used.
2. There can be multiple number of numeric column in the result of the query and all column will be treated as different series(legend).
