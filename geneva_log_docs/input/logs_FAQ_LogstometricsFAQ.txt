# FAQ

## How can I get help?

Click the [Contact Us](https://aka.ms/genevasupport) button in Jarvis, select the *Pipeline* area and follow the instructions.

## Can I write conversion rules against logs in national/sovereign clouds?

Yes. Just make sure to select   the correct **Endpoint** ("CA Fairfax", "CA Mooncake" or "CA BlackForest") when you are in the [Logs To metrics](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/manage/connectors/logs-to-metrics) page.

## I am getting permission/access issue while creating new LogsToMetrics conversions rule.

We recommend 2 ways to fix the issue.
1. Make sure you are using *ME or Torus account, and that *ME/Torus account were added to the Geneva Logs account.
2. Specifically for **Torus** - make sure the MDM account was updated with the correct alias - they have **<alias>_DEBUG** naming convention which is different than CORP that only has <alias> naming.

## Can I list/add/modify/delete a conversion rule programmatically?

No. At this point this can only be done through the Jarvis UI.
