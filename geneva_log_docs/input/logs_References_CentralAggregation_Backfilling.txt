# Backfilling for central derived events is only available for Billing teams






\*\* Please make sure that the derived events are idempotent, if they are not, you may end up incorrectly billing customers.



Customer's are required to create a complete set of commands to execute :



**Step 1**: Download the following utility:  \\reddog\Builds\branches\git_engsys_mda_mds_release_latest\retail-amd64\MdsWorkItemBackfiller



**Step 2**: Create the command for re-running a particular CDE.



*MdsWorkItemBackfiller.exe -command:ListStaticIds -MdsEndPoint:https://production.diagnostics.monitoring.core.windows.net/ -ConfigId:MdsVer12v0*



>[!Note]  
>Replace these values with the appropriate [endpoint ](https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/?page=documents&amp;section=1363da01-b6ed-43d4-970e-f89b011d591f&amp;id=d18a0cdb-eb0e-485b-b1bb-cbb6069d352b)and configid. Remember that config id is of the form "<namespace>Ver<eventVersion>v0". Get the namespace and eventVersion from the MA configuration file.



**Step 3**: Understand the delay there should be with respect to the next CDE in the chain. Insert the sleep in between the each of the backfilling command.



*MdsWorkItemBackfiller.exe -command:Schedule -MdsEndPoint:https://production.diagnostics.monitoring.core.windows.net/ -StaticId:255c21f217c333ee9d175571adaab0be\_\_\_\_\_\_MdsQosEventEtwTableUSWVer12v0\_\_\_MdsTfsProxyKpiFiveMinuteTableUSCVer12v0 -FromTime:2016-03-28T00:00:00.0Z -ToTime:2016-03-31T00:00:00.0Z -ConfigId:MdsVer12v0*



>[!Note]   
>These are the static ids listed through ListStaticIds command.



example:



CDE X runs first



CDE Y reads from destination table of CDE X.



CDE Z reads from destination table of CDE Y.



You will provide the following:



    
    re-schedule statements for CDE X
    sleep i
    re-schedule statements for CDE Y
    sleep j
    re-schedule statements for CDE Z
    Where i, j, k are the the amount of time you CDE typically needs to run multiplied by 1.5.



You can find the time needed to successfully run your CDE from our [Qos table query](https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/42EC0AAE) (take average of few runs).
