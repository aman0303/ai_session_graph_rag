The following sections describe specific notes and errors in more detail.


# 0.0.17-alpha

This release has the following limitations:

**Authentication:** 

- This release only supports the following authentication modes:

  | Logs Environment | AKV Cert Auth | Corp MSI Auth | AME MSI Auth |
  | - | - | - | - |
  | Smoke, Test, Stage | Yes | Yes | No |
  | ***Prod | Yes | No | Yes |

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > More tenants are supported in version 0.0.19-alpha: [GenevaAuthentication](./usage.md#genevaauthentication).

**Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk:**

- The assembly may fail to load if a strongly-named assembly is required.

  ```
  System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk, Version=0.0.17.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. A strongly-named assembly is required.
  ```

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This issue is resolved in version 0.0.18-alpha.

  This issue occurs because the assembly is Authenticode signed with a digital signature but is not strongly named.
  It can be loaded in assemblies that are not strongly-named.

**Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk.Blob.IO:**

- `BlobEventDataReader` may throw an exception on missing lz4 assemblies:

  ```
  System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'liblz4x64' or one of its dependencies: The specified module could not be found.
  ```

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This issue is resolved in version 0.0.18-alpha.

  This issue occurs because the lz4 assemblies are not binplaced correctly.
  It can be resolved by installing package `Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DataPipe.Blob.IO`.
  For example, in an SDK-style project:

  ```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.GenevaLogs.ExtensibilitySdk.Blob.IO" Version="0.0.17-alpha" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.DataPipe.Blob.IO" Version="5.16.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

  It can also be resolved in your project by binplacing the following files into your build output:

  ```
  \packages\microsoft.azure.monitoring.datapipe.blob.io\5.16.0\build\netstandard2.0\native\lib
      \liblz4ARM64.dll
      \liblz4arm64.so
      \liblz4x64.dll
      \liblz4x64.so
      \liblz4x86.dll
  ```
