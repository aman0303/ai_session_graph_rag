# Enabling your Logs QoS dashboard
Enabling the Logs QoS dashboard consists of connecting your [Logs Namespace configuration](./../../concepts/namespace.md) to your metrics account. By doing this, Geneva Pipeline will be able to post QoS metrics for this Logs Namespace, directly under your metrics account.

## How to enable Geneva Logs QoS metrics?
Your logs account that holds your [Logs Namespace configuration](./../../concepts/namespace.md) needs to be updated with your metrics account information. This metrics account will have QoS metrics posted directly to it.

__Steps:__
1) Go to [Jarvis > Account > Logs Account Settings](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/account/logs/account) and select the Geneva Logs account that you want to enable metrics.
2) Select **Account**.
3) Choose the Geneva Metrics account (MDM) that you want to map. The MDM accounts listed are the ones that you have admin privileges.

    >* This will not have any impact on Geneva Logs monitoring configurations associated with the account in scope.
    >* Once mapped it (or any changes thereafter) may take up to 30 minutes before the data appears in the Logs EndPoint QoS dashboard.
    >* The list of Geneva metrics accounts displayed are the ones that the user has Administrator permissions.
