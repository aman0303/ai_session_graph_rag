# How to monitor capacity utilization.

This tutorial shows how to set up alerts to monitor LogsToMetrics capacity utilization for your namespace.  

By judiciously monitoring capacity utilization and requesting for capacity increases when needed, you could prevent LogsToMetrics from throttling your data.

### Prerequisites
* [Alerting from Metrics](~/alerts/AlertingFrom/Metrics.md)
* [Author a monitor using multiple metrics](~/alerts/AuthorAMonitor/UsingMultipleMetrics.md)

### Steps

1. Geneva LogsToMetrics service exposes the following metrics to help with capacity monitoring, under `LogsToMetricsQos` MDM Namespace in your MDM Account.  

    `CapacityUtilization`: Capacity used by your namespace.  
    `Quota`: Pre allocated quota for your namespace.  
    `CapacityUtilizationPerRule`: Capacity used by a single rule in your namespace.  
    `QuotaPerRule`: Pre allocated quota for a single rule in your namespace.  

1. In Jarvis UI, go to page Manage->Metrics->Monitor. Fill in your MDM Account, Namespace: LogsToMetricsQoS, Metric: CapacityUtilization. Click Add to create a monitor.

1. Edit and customize the monitor, 
    1. Data Source section:  
        Pre-aggreggate: MdsEndpoint/EventNamespace  
        Dimension filters: Enter values for MdsEndpoint and EventNamespace  

    1. Alerting Logic section:  
        Use percentage template.  
        In the numerator, pick sampling type `Sum` from the chosen `CapacityUtilization` metric.  
        In the denominator, **click change metric and select `Quota` metric**, use sampling type `Sum`.  
        Then, fill out the alert condition as you desire.

    1. Health model section:  
        Pick an existing resource type or follow the below instructions to create a new resource type. This section instructs how geneva health system renders the resource being monitored and where IcM should route the incident for your team.
        1. Click Add resource Type and give it a name.
        1. Identifying dimensions should have MdsEndpoint and EventNamespace to match the metric being alerted on.
        1. Select an appropriate incident routing id for your team
        1. On the Health tree visualization page, give the resource a name. Then, add child levels for MdsEndpoint and EventNamespace. Here is an example:
        ![Health Tree](../images/ltm_capacityalert_healthtree.png)

1. Hit Save to save the monitor.

1. Now, we have created an alert for monitoring LTM capacity utilization at a namespace level.
