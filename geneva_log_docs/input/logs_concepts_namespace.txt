## Logs Namespace

A Log Namespace is essentially a unique prefix that you reserve per Log endpoint. 
All the monitoring data collected from your service will be identifiable through this unique prefix. 
Once you own a prefix, you can create multiple <i>Config</i> namespaces starting with that prefix.
We recommend that the namespace prefix you pick either match, or, in the event that it cannot, closely resemble your Log account name.

A valid Namespace field should adhere to the following constraints - 
* Must be between 5 and 31 characters

Note: We recommend users to create smaller namespaces (less than 15 characters). 
Event names are appended to end of the namespace when creating a blob container (namespace + event name + version info). 
If Event names become longer in the future, it would cause validation issues with config save.

* Must start with an alphabet
* Must be alphanumeric
