# Client Query

When using Log Search (DGrep) **client query** is executed in a centralized fashion on the results of the [server query](serverquery.md).
Because the rows are in memory, executing a client query is very fast and should be used for interactively analyze logs.

As an example, you're investigating a live site on a particular service.

- First you'd search for all the errors in the service in the **[server query](serverquery.md)**:

- Then interactively search/filter through the results in the **client query**:
