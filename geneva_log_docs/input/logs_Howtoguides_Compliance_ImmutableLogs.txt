# Geneva Immutable Logs
As part of the JEDI contract, Microsoft has to ensure that service security logs are immutable, i.e., cannot be edited or deleted. Service teams that have onboarded to Geneva and enabled collection of audit and security logs, will receive the immutability feature as part of AzSecPack and IFx integration with Geneva. Immutability is enabled by the Write Once Read Many (WORM) feature of [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/immutable-storage-for-azure-storage-blobs-now-generally-available/). Audit and security events are immutable for 30 days, and IFx events are immutable for 180 days.

Any service teams leveraging classic storage accounts are required to migrate their Geneva Logs accounts to [Geneva Storage Management (GSM)](../../Howtoguides/Manageaccount/MigrateToGsm.md) to meet the JEDI Enterprise Promise. Review the [Immutable Logs Troubleshooting Guide](./logImmutabilityTSG.md) if you haven't migrated you Geneva Logs account to GSM, or are experiencing issues related to immutable logs. 

## Role Based Access Control (RBAC) deny assignment in GSM
To prevent regressions related to immutable logs, Geneva applies a [deny assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/deny-assignments) on resources managed by the GenevaWarmPathResourceContributor role. This role is used by GSM to provision storage accounts and Event Hub resources in customer's subscriptions. The deny assignment is enabled by default on all GSM-managed resources (resource groups, storage accounts, and Event Hub namspaces), and it ensures that subscription administrators do not accidentally make changes to these resources.
