# How to delete broken/stale Central Derived Events

The steps below provide guidance on how you can safely delete CDEs via Jarvis. You should have received an email from Geneva Monitoring about stale/broken CDEs.

1.	Navigate to [Account > Logs Account Settings > Configurations](https://portal.microsoftgeneva.com/account/logs/configurations)
2.	Select *Diagnostics PROD* as the endpoint and the Geneva Logs account name where your CDEs reside
3.	Find the corresponding namespaces and click on the config file versions that you see listed in the *Possible Stale* and *Broken CDEs* tables on the dashboard (shared in the email). For example, if the table lists Ver1v0 , click on the Version 1.*v0 config link.
