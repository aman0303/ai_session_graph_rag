# Secure High-Performance .NET logging

## Overview

### Purpose

#### [Why did this line of code get marked?](#why-did-this-line-of-code-get-marked)

This line of code is marked as a violation of the KPI because it uses string
interpolation. The regex rule to define whether this line of code is using
string interpolation is as follows:

```cs
.Log(?:Critical|Debug|Error|Information|Trace|Warning)\(.*(?:\$|string.Format\()".+".*\)
```

#### [What is the engineering challenge that’s being addressed?](#what-is-the-engineering-challenge-thats-being-addressed)

Using string interpolation in logging code violates security best practices for
several reasons.

First, string interpolation can introduce security vulnerabilities. For example,
if an attacker uses injection techniques, the interpolated string can result in
unexpected behavior, potentially allowing unauthorized access or other security
breaches.

Second, string interpolation lacks a durable identifier (durable ID) to trace
each line of log data, making tracking and auditing difficult. Without a durable
ID, it's challenging to trace back to the exact line of code in the source. This
consistency is crucial for accurately identifying and redacting sensitive
information without losing the context of the log entries.

Third, string interpolation does not support structured payloads, which hinders
the ability to use tools for effective log analysis. Structured logging formats,
such as JSON, provide a more consistent and searchable log output, enabling
better troubleshooting and monitoring.

Finally, using string interpolation poses significant performance issues.
The process of creating interpolated strings can be computationally expensive,
especially in high-frequency logging scenarios. This can lead to unnecessary
performance overhead and impact the overall efficiency of the application.
See: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2254>.

#### Why is this problem significant? How will this solution help mitigate the issue?

In summary, avoiding string interpolation in .NET logging enhances security,
performance, and log analysis capabilities. Instead, use compile-time source
generation that supports structured logging and durable identifiers.

##### What is Durable ID?

Durable IDs are unique identifiers that remain consistent across different log
entries and sessions. They act like a GPS for debugging and analysis, allowing
you to trace logs back to the exact line of code in the source. This consistency
is crucial for accurately identifying and redacting sensitive information
without losing the context of the log entries.

##### What is the Structured Payload?

Structured payloads refer to the organization of log data into a well-defined
format, possibly a binary format, or as JSON or XML. This structure makes it
easier to identify and redact specific fields within the log entries.
For example, instead of having a flat log message, a structured payload might
separate different pieces of information into distinct fields, such as user_id,
transaction_id, and timestamp. This separation allows for more precise redaction
of sensitive data, such as email addresses or credit card numbers, without
affecting other parts of the log.

##### Why do we need Durable IDs?

Dropping or redacting portions of a log involves selectively removing or
obscuring specific data within log entries to protect sensitive information or
reduce noise. This practice is crucial for maintaining privacy and security, as
logs often contain personal or confidential data such as email addresses, credit
card numbers, or API keys. Additionally, dropping unnecessary log entries helps
in managing log storage efficiently and ensures that only relevant data is
retained for analysis. See: Logging guidance for .NET library authors. Instead
of string interpolation, use log message templates, formatting, and
argument lists.

#### When do the services need to address the problem and what factors contribute to the urgency?

## [How to fix violations](#how-to-fix-violations)

Migrate your code away from using string interpolation to do logging.
There are 2 options to do it. Options 1 is the preferred way to perform the
migration:

1. Refer to the "Migrate away from using string interpolation to compile-time
source generation with AI" section to save your time in bulk migration.

2. Migrate manually.

### [Migrate away from using string intepolation to compile-time source generation with AI](#migrate-away-from-using-string-intepolation-to-compile-time-source-generation-with-ai)

### Create your Azure OpenAI Model

#### Step 1

Follow [this doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal#deploy-a-model)
to deploy your AI model on Azure.

#### Step 2: Get the parameters to connect to your AI Model

2.1. Retrieve the endpoint: Once the AI model deployment is successful,
navigate to your Azure OpenAI Resource. Once inside your OpenAI resource,
look for a section on the left-hand menu called "Keys and Endpoint." Click
on it to access the endpoint information. Take a note of the endpoint. You
will need the endpoint information for the following steps.

2.2. Look for a section on the left-hand menu called "Model deployments",
click on the "Manage Deployments" button. You will be navigated to the Azure
OpenAI Studio where you can retrieve the language model and deployment name
information. For example, the deployment name of the below model is
"yunlModel" and the language model is "gpt-4". These information will be
used in the following steps.

### Create your first commit with AI for string interpolation to compile-time logging source generation

BandishCLI is an AI tool developed by Microsoft Research and M365. Follow the
steps below to create your first commit with AI.

1. Check whether your codebase is using the latest stable version of
[Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging/9.0.0-preview.7.24405.7#versions-body-tab)
package. If not, update to use the latest stable version, which has the
support for compile-time logging source generation for all supported
versions of .NET/.NET Standard/.NET Framework.

2. Install the [prerequisites](https://dev.azure.com/O365Exchange/O365%20Core/_git/AISelfServe?path=/sources/dev/readme.md&version=GBmaster&_a=preview&anchor=prerequisites) and [BandishCLI](https://dev.azure.com/O365Exchange/O365%20Core/_git/AISelfServe?path=/sources/dev/readme.md&version=GBmaster&_a=preview&anchor=installing-bandishcli).

3. Use the parameters you've gotten from step 2. to [connect to your Azure
OpenAI model](https://dev.azure.com/O365Exchange/O365%20Core/_git/AISelfServe?path=/sources/dev/readme.md&version=GBmaster&_a=preview&anchor=1.-running-bandish-transformation-using-public-scenarios).

4. Follow the steps below to create your first pull request for the ILogger
logging migration with the help of AI!

```powershell
(BandishCLIRun) PS C:\repos\azure-sdk-for-net\sdk> BandishCLI scenario run -o local_write --scenario-name OTel_ILogger_bestPractice_KB --repo-path <LOCAL_REPO_PATH>
```

> ***NOTE:*** BandishCLI commit_push and pull_request options for large repo
> transformation will be supported soon!

Below is an example command of transforming a local repo and create
AI-generated transformations.

```powershell
(BandishCLIRun) PS C:\repos\azure-sdk-for-net\sdk> BandishCLI scenario run -o local_write --scenario-name OTel_ILogger_bestPractice_KB --repo-path "C:\repos\azure-sdk-for-net\sdk\eventhub\Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs\src\Listeners\"
```

After BandishCLI finish transformation, you will see the AI-authored output
files got written to a staging folder locally. You can find the output
directory from the output logs of the BandishCLI run command.

![outputDirectory](../images/outputDirectory.JPG)

5. Use the below command to update your files in the original repo folder with
the AI transformed version.

```powershell
# Update the below param to your <PATH_TO_THE_STAGING_FOLDER_FROM_THE_OUTPUT_OF_BANDISHCLI>.
# This is from the output of BandishCLI at step 3.4.
$sourceFolder = "C:\Users\yunl\staging\6d1d17fd-642c-45c8-8ff7-8bf6aee10f98\s"
# Update the below param to your <ORIGINAL_REPO_PATH>.
$destinationFolder = "C:\repos\azure-sdk-for-net\sdk\eventhub\Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs\src\Listeners\"

$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $sourceFolder -Recurse -Filter "*_fixed.cs"

foreach ($file in $files) 

 -- openCurlyBracket -- 

    Copy-Item -Path $file.FullName -Destination $destinationFolder

 -- closeCurlyBracket -- 


$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $destinationFolder -Recurse -Filter "*_fixed.cs"

foreach ($file in $files)

 -- openCurlyBracket -- 

    $newFileName = $file.Name -replace "_fixed.cs$", ".cs"
    $newFilePath = Join-Path -Path $file.DirectoryName -ChildPath $newFileName

    if (Test-Path -Path $newFilePath) 
 -- openCurlyBracket -- 

        Remove-Item -Path $newFilePath -Force
    
 -- closeCurlyBracket -- 


    Rename-Item -Path $file.FullName -NewName $newFileName
    Write-Output "Updated '$newFilePath' to be the AI transformed version."

 -- closeCurlyBracket -- 

```

6. Now you can see the AI-transformed version in your source control system,
review it, commit it, and create a PR.

7. Check out the knowledge-based documents
[here](https://dev.azure.com/O365Exchange/O365%20Core/_git/AISelfServe?version=GBAISS-Public-KB&path=/OTel_ILogger_bestPractice_KB)
to learn more about how the AI perform the migration from string
interpolation to compile-time logging source generation using
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### Post-Implementation

Now, review the AI-generated code change.
Use the below regex in the IDE to scan again to check whether there are still
any matches:

```cs
.Log(?:Critical|Debug|Error|Information|Trace|Warning)\(.*(?:\$|string.Format\()".+".*\)
```

If there is no remaining matches. Congratuliations!
The S360 KPI violation is fixed. Push a new commit to the repo and the KPI
violation warnings will be resolved.
