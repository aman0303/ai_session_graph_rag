# How to choose a moniker failover option
To meet data residency requirements, in addition to providing ways for collecting Dial Tone logs in emergency situations, Geneva Logs supports tne following moniker failover scenarios:

1. Classic moniker failover -  If your Geneva Logs account is [Geneva Storage Management (GSM)-enabled](./gsm_gcsenabled.md) Geneva Logs will provision a single moniker in the requested region. If your account is not GSM enabled, you are responsible for provisioning a moniker in the requested region. 
    * If your Geneva Logs account is GSM-enabled, and no resources are yet available in the requested region, GSM will attempt to provision a moniker in the nearest region instead. If no nearest region is available, or GSM is unable to provision a moniker there, the request will fail. 
    * If your Geneva Logs account is not GSM-enabled, and no resources are yet available in the requested region, Geneva Logs will return at least one moniker from the nearst region, or from the nearest storage group.    
2. Restricted moniker failover - enforce data residency in the requested region. Geneva Logs will only provision a moniker in the requested region. 
     * If your Geneva Logs account is GSM-enabled, and no moniker is available in the requested region, GSM will attempt to provision a new moniker.
     * If your Geneva Logs account it not GSM-enabled, and no moniker is available in the requested region, no moniker will be returned. 
3. Geo Isolated moniker failover - enforce data residency in regions with traditional regional pair defined. Geneva Logs will return a moniker in the requested region as the primary moniker, and a moniker in the paired region as the secondary moniker.
    * The paired regions (and thus the provisioned monikers) reside in the same geography. 
4. Dial Tone - prioritize having critical data available for recovery over data isolation.
    * If a region has a traditional regional pair defined, Geneva Logs will return a moniker in the requested region as the primary moniker, and a moniker in the paired region as the secondary moniker.
    * If a region has no traditional regional pair defined, Geneva Logs will return a moniker in the requested region as the primary moniker, and a moniker in the "recovery region" (as defined by Azure Global/DCMT) as the secondary moniker.

## Onboarding to your chosen moniker failover option

1. Upgrade your Monitoring Agent (MA) to version 45.0.1 or higher.
2. Update the variable ```monikerRegionFailoverOption``` in the Management section in your configuration file with the failover option you require. Values for this variable can be either Classic, Restricted, GeoIsolated or Dialtone.

>[!Note]
>If you choose Dialtone as a failover option, you must also have onboarded to [Geneva Ingestion Gateway (GIG)](../../../collect/references/genevaingestiongateway.md). Dial Tone support is only available for data written to GIG and not directly to storage. GIG supports connection to storage through IPv6, and will ensure telemetry collection in a different region during an outage.

>[!Note]
>Onboarding to [Geneva Ingestion Gateway (GIG)](../../../collect/references/genevaingestiongateway.md) is not required to meet data residency compliance when selecting Classic, Restriced, or Geo Isolated moniker failover options.

>[!Note]
>If no value is set for monikerRegionFailoverOption, the default is Classic, which is the previous behavior before the addition of this new functionality.

>[!Note]
>It is recommended to update the configuration on the Monitoring Agent after making the configuration changes to choose a moniker faliover scenario, and follow [Safe Deployment Practices](./MigrateToGCS.md#safe-deployment-practices-sdp).
    
## How will the moniker failover selection affect your logs data consumption? 
Moniker failover is an automatic process. That means that your logs may land in the paired region transiently, if the logs data plane is unable to write to a moniker in the primary region. Depending on your data consumption choice, consider the failover option and make updates accordingly:

*	DGrep - if you are using “Region” scoping condition, which filters on the region of the moniker, make sure to include the primary and paried regions. Otherwise there should not be any change. 
*	Kusto - if you using regional Kusto clusters, which are selected based on the region of the moniker, consider the primary and paired regions. Otherwise there should not be any change.
* 	Extensibility SDK - if your SDK is configured to filter by moniker OR region, consider the parimary and paired regions. Otherwise there should not be any change.
*	GDS - data will land in an Event Hub based on the region of the moniker. Make sure you consider this when consuming data.
