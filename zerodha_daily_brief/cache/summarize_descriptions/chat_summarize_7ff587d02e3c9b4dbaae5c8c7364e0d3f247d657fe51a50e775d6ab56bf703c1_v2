Despite its declining role due to the global shift toward renewable energy sources, coal remains a significant contributor to the global energy mix, supplying 34.4% of electricity worldwide. It is particularly dominant in countries like China and India, where it plays a critical role in meeting electricity demand spikes, such as during extreme heatwaves, and accounts for approximately 75% of India's electricity generation through combustion in power plants.
