The nation heavily relies on coal for electricity generation, which constitutes a substantial part of its energy mix. This dependence on coal is particularly pronounced during periods of high demand, such as during extreme heat events. However, India is also actively pursuing renewable energy initiatives, with a strong emphasis on solar and wind power, as part of its strategy to transition away from fossil fuels and enhance energy security.
