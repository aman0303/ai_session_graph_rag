Everyone seems to consider this the financial apocalypse. The stock markets are deep in the red, and a range of businesses are making cryptic statements about how they need to “restructure their supply chains.”\n\nThrough all this, there’s a good chance that you don’t actually know why this is such a big deal. You’ve probably heard all the basic explainers already — about how tariffs are essentially import taxes — without a real sense of why a few tax hikes can cause the world to lose its collective mind.\n\nWe get it. This isn’t something you’re expected to know. People don’t spend their days thinking about supply chains. It’s really easy to underestimate how critical global value chains are, how widely they spread, or how fragile they can be in the face of a crisis. But make no mistake, they’re the basis of the plentiful lives we live. They’re the reason you even have the device you’re reading this on, even.\n\nTo help you understand why, though, we’ll need to take you into the mundane, boring exchanges at the heart of the global economy. If you stick with us, though, we promise you’ll learn a little more about why it’s so tragic that these are all suddenly in jeopardy.\n\nGlobal supply chains are a miracle of mankind\nModern commerce exists because of global value chains.\n\nMost modern industrial products are like giant lego installations. They’re made by putting together a huge array of pieces, most of which are made by other people. As the economist Leonard Reed noted almost seventy years ago, there isn’t a single person alive who knows how to make a single lead pencil from scratch. Pencil-making is a collaborative exercise between millions of people. Some of them chop the wood, some of them dig for clay, some of them mine raw graphite, and so on. None of these people can see more than the smallest sliver of the complete supply chain. And yet, by coming together, they make millions of pencils every day.\n\nWhat’s true of pencils is a million times as true for the more advanced products we take for granted: from car batteries to mobile phones.\n\nThere are places in the world that have world-beating expertise in making single, specific parts of those giant lego installations. Their products, by themselves, could seem mundane. For instance, you may run an entire business around making one very specific spring, which only goes into making the accelerometers that are used in iPhones. We aren’t exaggerating at all, by the way. Consider this: Toyota, for instance, sources 400,000 different products to make its cars. Boeing sources 6 million different components for its airplanes. Anything they do depends on layers and layers of suppliers. If this is hard to wrap your head around, here’s an illustration of a simple supply chain. This should tell you how quickly the number of suppliers can multiply:\n\nThis extreme specificity brings huge advantages. You can spend all your time and energy thinking of how to perfect one specific spring, making it more cheaply and efficiently than anyone else. Different suppliers do the same thing for their own components. Because of all the effort of all those suppliers, taken together, making extremely complicated products becomes cheaper and quicker as a whole. That is why you can get an entire phone — a computer, communications device, camera, music system, and a dozen other things rolled into one — for just a few thousand Rupees.\n\nBut here’s the catch: this only works because of the incredible scale at which these value chains operate. Making accelerometer springs for phones sold in Southern Karnataka, where we live, isn’t really a viable business idea. But if you can do so for a big chunk of every phone sold in the world, suddenly, you have a million-dollar business plan. When you hear headlines about India trying to ‘establish itself as part of global value chains’, this is what they’re talking about — creating excellent, hyper-specialised businesses that can become small parts of mammoth supply chains.\n\nThis is why the scale and efficiency of global supply chains are two sides of the same coin. Neither makes sense without the other.\n\nThese supply chains are incredibly fragile\nWhen you zoom into any part of one of those global supply chains, you’ll realise how incredibly fragile they are. If any one node of a supply chain goes under, that hurts everyone that it supplies products to. Which, in turn, hurts the next entity in the chain. And so on.\n\nThe results can be dramatic. If one supplier in a smartphone supply chain faces problems sourcing a single 5 cent capacitor, for instance, that could block entire shipments of $1000 phones.\n\nWe saw hints of this in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen people across the world began working from home, there was a huge surge in the demand for computers all over the world. Chip manufacturers started routing their production to this segment, while car manufacturers temporarily stopped placing orders for them. A few months later, though, when they resumed production, there were no chips available.\n\nNow, chips aren’t too big a part of cars: they run things like power steerings, sensors and infotainment systems. They’re no more than 5-10% of a car’s cost. But you can’t make cars without chips. And so, as chips became hard to come by, global automobile production slumped by 26%. The price of cars swung wildly for years, only easing late last year.\n\nThis is why simple intuitions don’t work if you’re thinking about world trade.

This will take time, and in the meanwhile, they’ll bleed money.\n\nOf babies and bathwater\nAnd that’s why everyone’s losing their marbles.\n\nTrump may be right in some limited sense — of how America has de-industrialised. In response, however, he has committed one of the most profound acts of throwing the baby out with the bathwater in recent history.\n\nThe new tariffs don’t just “hurt trade.” They upend a system built over decades — one where efficiency didn’t come from a single country being great at everything, but from many businesses across a variety of countries being world-class at one thing. The plenty we see around us all comes from the long chains these businesses formed — as though they were running a long industrial relay race. The tariffs disrupt relationships between those thousands of companies that, until now, worked together like pieces in a gigantic, invisible machine.\n\nThey’ve introduced uncertainty where there was precision, and friction where there was once flow. We don’t know what comes after this. As all the disruption during COVID showed us, economies don’t work in linear, intuitive ways. When one part of the economy breaks, it can throw seemingly unrelated parts of the economy into complete chaos.\n\nThat’s why tariffs trigger panic. Not because they’re conceptually scary, but because they casually threaten a system so vast and interdependent that even small shocks can cascade. Because nobody — not businesses, not economists, not even the governments imposing them — can fully predict what happens when you start messing with supply chains this intricate.\n\nEnergy all over the world\nWe’ve previously talked about the World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA).
